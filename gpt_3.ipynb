The goal of the neural network is to learn the input data and then be able to classify new input data into the classes. Based on the learned information the network then maps input data into one of the classes, which is discrete space. In regression the input data is learned aswell. But here the network tries to predict feature values, which are in continuous space. The network tries to predict close as possible to new input data only using the learned model.\\n\\n                Reference answer: Classification is a task of mapping data to discrete labels while regression is a task which maps data to a continuous function or real values.

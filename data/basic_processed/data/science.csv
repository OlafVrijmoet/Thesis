2830,,213,plastic type i is the polymer with the most stretchability. at the end of the experiment this is apparent because in both trials it stretched the most mme two ways to make the experiment better would be to leave the weights on for a longer period of time and also to add more weight on another was would be to make the experiment better would be to leave the heights on for a younger period of time and also to add more weight on another way would be to use a double thickness of each material in evert trials,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2831,,213,the conclusion that i draw based on the student's data is that plastic a stretched the most two ways that the students could have improved their experimental design andlor validity of their results would be to test all the materials at least three times and to and to allow the weights to hang longer than five minutes testing all materials three times improves the student validity because it becomes more accurate allowing weights to hang longer make it easier to see which material stretches the most,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2832,,213,a after review of the results one can conclude that plastic type i as the most stretchable and durable this is because it had the highest my stretch distance for both trials.^p be the student could have improved the results validity by performing 2 more trials after 2 minutes by giving the plastics time to recover he can either test the durability over time,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
2833,,213,based on the students data plastic type i stretched the most with 22 and 23 where as plastic type a stretched 10 and 12. up one way they could improve is as by making the size of the plastic constant another way thing could improve it is by making sure that when your letting it hang to stop it at exactly 5 minutes as you can keep the time constant too,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2834,,213,the students conclusion of this trial would be plastic type 4 produced comm of stretching for to and to produced comm so it increased by ammo type i produced comm of strechability for to and comm for to for an increase of ammo type 3 produced comm of stretch ability for to and comm for to decreasing by ammo and lastly type i produced 20 my of stretchability for to and 20 my for the that's what a students conclusion would look like,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
2835,,213,abased on the data its possible that he's hypothesis was right because the data seams close to each other so there's a higher possibility rigth than wrong up i the could have made more trials including a control variable one that doesn't change ) another way as by adding more weights but do the procedure a little bat different,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2836,,213,i have concluded that plastic i is the stretches and plastic a is the least stretchiest. a validity issue could have been leaving the weights on to long another validity issue could have been the measuring of the plastics was off,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666

2870,,213,a based off the information given plastic type i stretched the most the type do type ca type a up be place more weight & let it hang longer or less,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2871,,213,plastic i didn't change and plastic a stretched more in trial 2. basically most of the plastics change but not all of them up one way is making each plastic the same length before the experiment a second way is use the same amount of tape for each plastic type,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2872,,213,according to the student's data the plastic that stretched the most was plastic type i and the one that stretched the least was plastic type a up i think that this experiment could have been improved by instead of having a second trial you should have added more time,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
2873,,213,from the data given to me i can draw the conclusion that plastic type a is the least stretchable of the plastics probably because of it's tight bonding plastic i on the other hand is the most strechable of the polymers loose bonding one way the student could have improved his results could have been a ord trial that would improve the validity a second way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to ensure one self to have the same length plastic and time the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2874,,213,a plastic type i is the stretches plastic in to it stretched 22 mme and in to it stretched 23mm. the least stretched plastic was type a in the a stretched comm and in to it stretched 12mm. type i was second stretches and type i was behind do up be two ways the student could have improved the experimental design/validity of the experiment is having a specific size of the original piece of plastic to stretch and having a specific weight of the weight stretching the plastic constant keep the results of experiment valid,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2875,,213,one conclusion i made is that overtime in trial 2 it goes farther than in trial 1 the numbers increase two ways the student have improved on their experiment is by is by being more specific in their procedure and by adding a trial 3.,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2876,,213,2.)at the end of the experiment i have concluded that plastic i had the best stretchability because in 1 and 2 it reached 22 my the first time and 23 my the second time my hypothesis was also wrong because i had predicted plastic a would have the most stretchability but it didn't.^p (b)1.put something heavier then weights (2)attach something other then a clamp,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2877,,213,a my conclusion based on the student's data is that to apb held a stronger than for the i for to was the one more my than to but both trials seemed out for plastic type do up be two ways those students could have improved is if they kept the plastic the same size and shape and if they let hang for a min longer,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2878,,213,a out of all the plastic plastic a is the stretchiest. based on the data it stretches 2 my while the others stretched 1 my or 0 mme up be to improve the experiment the student could have used plastics that were all the same length to begin with the student also should've verified the weight of the weights they used and made alls they used the same weight throughout,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2879,,213,a in conclusion plastic i had the most stretchability. up be one way the student could have improved this experiment could be to start with the same length of plastic for each trial & each plastic the second way i would change the experiment would be to use a stop watch & be very preside about the time,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2880,,213,a the conclusion i have drawn about the students data table is that plastics a and i where stretchable. while i actually decrease in size and i did not stretch at all up be two ways that the student could improve this experiment is by naming the different plastics so you know your not looking the same kind of plastic that then once also to add more trials because they only held two,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333

2911,,213,according to the student's data plastic type i was able to stretch the longest with 23mm. type i was close with comm but types i and a were for less stretchy with comm and comm respectively the student should have specified how long the plastic sample should be eat the student should have also specified how much weight was added to the clamps for all i know he would have used random lengths and weights for each trial so he should have been clearer in the procedure,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2912,,213,based on the students data plastic type i stretched the most however the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of these results first off their should be a required standard length for each type of plastic the directions could be like step i cut a comm strip of each plastic also this experiment should specify the amount of weight placed on the clamp and this exact amount should be repeated throughout the rest of the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2913,,213,a from the table shown you can conclude that plastic type i in this investigation could stretch the farthest meaning it is the strongest of all the defend types because it stretched comm and 23mm. up be i could have said how much weight to start with each time putting different stress levels on the plastics i told how long to keep the weight on beforeadding on more because this could cause a change in strength or stretchability.,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
2914,,213,based on the students data i can conclude that plastic i stretches the most out of all the plastics up be two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by being specific about the length of each piece of plastic another way they could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2915,,213,a the plastic did in fact stretch only in to 23 my up be the student could have used more weights on the second trial or maybe on the second trial let it being longer,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
2916,,213,based on the students data we could see that plastic type i was the polymer that stretched the most for both trials they had a longer length than all of the others of comm and23mm. one way the student could have improved the experimental design could have been to note on the graph how long the polymer was before it was stretched,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2917,,213,the plastic type i is stretched the same amount in both trials one thing they could of improved on is they should have have 3 trials not just 2.,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2918,,213,a based on the data shown in the experiment plastic i had the most stretchability and plastic a had the least stretchability. up be they could have improved their experiment by 1. starting out with the amount of weight for each plastic and 2. they could have performed one more trial to make sure their results were correct,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2919,,213,if we stretched 4 different types of plastics then the second plastic plastic do would strech the farthest up two ways the students could improve the experimental design and for validity of the results are naming the plastics to know which one is which so the data will not get mixed up also doing more than 2 trials another trial might helped the data,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2920,,213,well they improved by making the right design and following the right instructions,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
2921,,213,based on the results shown plastic i has the highest stretchability. after adding weight to the plastic for 5 minutes it showed that plastic i stretched the most 22 and 23 mme next in high stretchability comes do i then a even though this experiment was good there are two ways to improve the experimental design i think they should have tested how different weights effected each type of plastic i also believe that there should be a controlled group one with no weight to compare the results of adding the weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2922,,213,a i think that the plastic type a was the strongest because it stretched down the least plastic type i was least strongest because it went down the most up be the student could included more trials to add validity the student could have also included how much weight was being added to the plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2923,,213,you can came to a conclusion that plastic type i was the most stretchable for trial one it got comm and for trial it got comm compared to the others that only got in the teens but 0 got comm both trials,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2924,,213,based on the students data i can conclude that plastic type a is the most durable.^p two ways the student could have improved this experiment would be to clarify how much weight was added to each plastic and to measure the plastic before herthe stretched it,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2925,,213,a polymer i has a higher streethability cuts that all the other plastics tested up be the students can able more trials to their experiments also they can clarity what type of plastic tins being used,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2926,,213,"a plastic type i was the stretchiest, while a stretched the least up i 1.) make sure the plastics were all the same length up 2.) measure the plastics during the process of stretching",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2927,,213,plastic a + i stayed stretched from the to and then stretched more in the i went down so it probably gets shorter as you wear it out i guess i stayed the same up they should of added the amount of weight the attached to each plastic they should of said how much the clamp weighed,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2928,,213,"a conclusion made from the students data is that different plastics length are affected by weight in their own ways staying the same , growing , or shortening the students could have been more specific by writing down how long each plastic has originally before the the 2 trials they also could have been more detailed about how much weight they were adding to the plastic",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2929,,213,a in conclusion plastic type be stretched the most the data says it stretched comm on trial one and comm on trial 2. up be one way the student could change the procedure is allow them to hang for 10 min instead of 5 minutes also they could change it up by changing the weights every time,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2930,,213,a based on the data shown on the table i would say that plastic type i has the most amount stretched up be the first way is would of presented the result better and have more trails second it says allow them to hang fro five mins it should ve been 10-15 mins mins does nothing,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2931,,213,a plastic a is stretched the biggest throughout the experiment while plastic i shoved no change be up the student could have improved the validity by adding more traits because the plastic would have stretched larger if there were more trials and also add constants because if more things are the same throughout the experiment then the results would be more valid,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2932,,213,according to the data provided this experiment had roughly the same outcomes in trial 1 and trial 2. it's either one number higher or lower in trial 2. but there're two ways that this experiment could be improved one explain what type of plastics are being stretched two say how much weight is going to be added to the clamps,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2933,,213,a plastic i stretched the most plastic a was the strongest out of all up be they should have added more weights to see which would have stretched the most and which would be stronger,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2934,,213,based on the result of the experiments we can conclude that plastic type i has the greatest elasticity of the four plastics one way the students could have improved on their experiments is to run a third test adding another test should show they would get result similar too the first two tests,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2935,,213,a concluding from the students data plastic type a is the strongest plastic i is the least strongest is the third and i is the least durable be the student could have improved this experiment is by doing at least one more trial they could have made a cooled and warmly the dependent independent variables to ran to this experimental design are varied,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2936,,213,a in conclusion the plastic type i stretched the most in both trials it's the stretchiest. up be the student could of stretched it by two students holding both sides and simply pulling with weights on it they could of repeated the procedure one more time they should of had a control grape,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2937,,213,a a conclusion that i have concluded from the data table is plastic type ab and do were stretched the most leaving type a and ca being the most durable types of plastic.^p be two ways that the students could have improved there experiment design or validity are more trials for more accuracy and more plastic types to experiment with to actually find out which one is the most durable,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2938,,213,a my conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type a is the one that stretches the most up be two things the student could of did to make his experiment better is one tell us how much the weights weighed and two tell us the plastic types of polymer be used,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2939,,213,"i conclude that plastic type i would be the best plastic for stretchability, because in both trials plastic i is the one that stretched the farthest in trial 1 it stretched 22mm, and trial 2 it stretched 23mm. the student could have improved the validity by giving specific measurements for size of plastic so lure are all equal the student also could have sold to use the plastics when they were all the same day the ages that are isn't older or weaver than another plastic",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2940,,213,a based on the students data a good conclusion to make is that plastic i was the strongest up be some ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be they should of said how much the weight weighed also they could of done more trials to make the experiment more valid also how much did the clamp weigh to make it more accurate results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2941,,213,a i conclude that plastic i has the highest tensile strength be they could have said how much weight to add as well as add a different amount of weight for the second trial preferably a higher amount,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2942,,213,polymer a is a more hard and less valuable plastic which would been it would be like a 1 on 3 plastic i is really valuable and stretch so it would be a polite polymer they could improve on the design by may be using more weight so they get more stretch and see its limits and way it stretches because so polymers stretch in different directions they would do one more trial to get more data and make it more valid,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2943,,213,a based on the students date i can conclude that plastic type i is the most flexible at all the samples up be to improve their experimental design the students could have added more trials and also specified how much weight to add,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2944,,213,my conclusion is that plastic type a has the least stretchability and plastic type i has the most stretchability compared to both trials one way to have improved the experiment design would have been to add weights and let them hang foe ten minutes for the second trial and perform more trials with longer times with weights on the plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2945,,213,the student could say how much weight he used also increase the weight in the second trial they should also perform the trial atleast 3 times to increase the validity of the results the students must also increase the time of hanging process,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2946,,213,the measures of every plastic should be the same to start secondly there should be a precise amount of weights being added my conclusion is that type i stretched the most it was easily the longest,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2947,,213,the student can conclude that polymer plastic i is the most strechability because it has the longest length in both trials.two ways this experiment could have been better is by saying how much weight to add to each plastic polymer and second by repeating the experiment more than twice,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2948,,213,i conclude that plastic type i stretched the most one way the students could have improved the experiment design and / or validity of the results is to make sure all the plastic types start out at the same length another way is to have a certain amount of weights for all the plastic type trials,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2949,,213,a no conclusion can be drawn from this experiment because the length of the plastic before the weights are added we not listed therefore you can no see with plastic stretched the farthest up be two was they can improve the validity of this experiment are 1. list the length of the plastic before its stretched and 2. state how much the weight weigh and if they all the same,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2950,,213,a based on the students data i can conclude that plastic type i was the most stretchable. this is because it was stretched more than the other plastic after 5 minutes in both trials for example plastic i stretched 22 my in the first trial but plastic i the next most stretchable only stretched 20 mme the students could have improved the experiment adding more trials this would make their experiment more accurate because they will have more both to use their by they should have also tell how many weights to add at a time so that they and whoever else does this experiment remains constant,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2951,,213,based on the student's data the trials for each of the different plastics were very similar and showed no significant chang in how much the plastic stretched two ways to be more specific on exactly how much weight is to be added to the clamp also the student should include how big each plastic sample should be because if they used four different size samples the results would be inaccurate,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2952,,213,plastic type i streets the further out of the other three what happens to plastic when i get low to the ground how much weight do they put to the end of these plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2953,,213,a plastic type i has the most stretchability out of them all type i has the second most type i has the third mast and type a has the least up be one way the experimental design could be improved is by saying how much the weights weight also it would have been better if they averaged both trials together also,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2954,,213,2 plastic type i can stretch the most without bearing to the students could have conducted more trials which could have improved the experimental design and validity the students also should have specified the weights of each weights and the clamp so if someones were to repeat the experiment they would known how much weight to add,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2955,,213,a the percentage of the amount the plastic stretched was lot lower in the second trial than in the first up be they could have done more trials they could have used more polymer plastics,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2956,,213,plastic type be has the most stretchability after trials 1 and 2.,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2957,,213,i drew a conclusion based on the students data that plastic type i stretched out the most in my for both trial one and trial turn one way the students could have improved their experimental design is that they could've informed us what type of plastics were being tested like garbage bag freezer bag and sandwich bag another way the students could've improved their experiments by how many weights did they put in for each plastic bag they stretched out,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2958,,213,based on the students data you can conclude that plastic i is more durable than the rest of the plastics tested also that plastic a was the least durable out of the plastics one way the students could improve their experiment is if they have at least 3 trials instead of just 2. another thing the group could do to improve their experiment is to identify the independent and dependent variables in their procedure,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2959,,213,a my conclusion to the polymer investigation is that plastic be is more likely to stretch the longest in five minutes up be they experiment could had been improved if they added more trials to show consistency or change in the experiment another way to give a hypothesis to show if you predicted wright or wrong,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2960,,213,a based on the data given i can see that plastic a is the strongest polymer and doesn't have much stretchability. up be to validate her results i think the student should have put how long the plastic was originally and how many millimeters long it was after the weights to see the actual data for ourselves the student could tested the plastic a third time to improve her experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2961,,213,a to conclude polymer plastic i has the highest strech in meters up be add different weights up see which is more durable or stronger up clamp each differently,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2962,,213,a conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type i is the most flexible plastic and can stretch the farthest the student could have improved their experiment by stating how heavy the weights were that were attached to the clamp right now one can only guess what weight that was another way the student could have improved their experiment is by stating the original length of all the plastics cutting them all to a certain length would improve the validity of the experiment because it would show plastic i actually stretched the farthest and did not just showed off changes,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2963,,213,from the data given i conclude that plastic i had the most strech ability and plastic a had the least two ways this experiments could be improved is by using the same size plastic for each type of plastic and by stating how many he used,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2964,,213,a two out of the four plastic types lengths increased up be first the students should have more trials and allow the weights to hang more than five minutes on to the clamp,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2965,,213,in each trial both 1 and i the amount stretched increased steadily and ended at the same amount two ways the student's could have improved there experiment was by saying how much weight to put on the clamps another way to improve the experiment was to say how far would they have wanted the weight and clamps to be far down or far up,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2966,,213,a plastic sample i was the stretches because it's greatest length was 23mm. up be they should have measured the length of the plastic before they stretched it so we can know how much it stretched they also should have run more than two trials so we can be absolutely sure of their results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2967,,213,a based on only the data shown one can conclude that plastic the most stretchability out of all the plastic tested because it stretched the most during the experiment one can also assume that plastic type a has the least stretchability because it stretched the least during the experiment one way that the experimental design could have been improved is to have controlled the original lengths of all the plastics and make them equal another way to have improved the experimental design is to have included the exact weight that was being applied to the plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2968,,213,a some plastics are more strictly or maybe some of them are harder than the other brands.^p be they could of put the time period a little longer also for to they could of put more weight than the,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
2969,,213,akin conclusion plastic type i has stretched the most probably not the most dependable material the best plastic type would be a plastic type a can withstand the most support of weight in the bag so you don't have to worry about it ripping up be these students should have conducted a third trial it would have made for finding a better average of stretching on the plastic type also explain how much weight was stretching these plastic bags,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2970,,213,the conclusion that i have drawn is that plastic type i stretched the most which makes it more durable than the rest two ways he could have improved was by telling us how much weight was added and by telling us he averaged out the three plastic samples strechness.,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2971,,213,a the total amount of to is greater than the up be all lengths should be the same and every step should be equal to the others,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
2972,,213,from the students data from conclude that type i is most stretch able and that type a is the least stretchable. this lab couldn't been improved by saying to record the measurements in steps 7 & 5. also by taking what until to measure with in steps 7 & 5.,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0

2974,,213,a from the table results for the experiment you can conclude that type i was the most stretchable out plastic and type a was the strongest at holding together the polymers and cross linking made it strong up be she could have improved the experiment by allow more trials and making sure the plastic samples were the same size and length,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2975,,213,a the polymer plastic withe biggest stretchability was type i because it stretched over 22mm. be the students should have measured the amount of my the plastic stretch while the clamps were still on also the students should have used plastics of all the same length,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2976,,213,"a in conclusion different polymer plastics do have different stretchabilities, some polymers such as i and i , are much more stretchable than polymers such as a and cop be the student could have improved this experiment by specifying the amount of weight used and how far to let them hang also the student should have specified how to calculate the amount of polymer stretched",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2977,,213,a in conclusion plastic type i in trial 1 and trial 2 stretched more then plastic type a ca and drop be two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are they could of tested more times to get better results and they could of let the weights stay in the bag a bit longer before removing them,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2978,,213,it has been confirmed according to the data in the table that plastic type i can be stretched out the longest compared to plastic types arc and do plastic type i reached length of comm which is the highest length measure in the table two ways the student can improve there design / or validity of their results is by collecting more data and creating more trials to get a more accurate results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2979,,213,based on the student's data plastic type i stretched the most for both trials so that would be the one to choose when looking for the most stretchable. the first way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing a third trial the second way the student could have improved the experimental design is by making sure all the clamps and weights are the same and are hanging for exactly the same amount of time,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2980,,213,a when stretched plastic i seemed to be weakest and stretch the most as where plastic a seemed strongest up one way is to have equal size plastics to start with another way is to say exactly how much weight needed to be added to each,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2981,,213,the conclusion that can be drawn from the data done in that plastic type be stretched the most which was comm in to and comm in the one way the student could've improved the experiment is to add another trial also by using the same weight to weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2982,,213,a based on the student's data plastic type i was more flexible and susceptible to stretching plastic type a was most likely a harder or thicker type of plastic making it more difficult to stretch up be to improve the experiment and validity of the results the students could have run more than two trials so they had more to compared they also could have included record results in their procedure,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2983,,213,my conclusion will be that with the added weight the plastics stretched up to make this trial more reliable the student should have stated how long and wide each plastic should be the students should have also stated how much weight should be added to the plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2984,,213,a based on the student's data plastic i is the most stretchable polymer plastic and plastic a is the least stretchable. up be one way the students could improve their experiment is to perform more than just two trials to ensure their data is valid another way they could improve their experimental design is to specify how it tape the plastics so as to make sure their are all taped and pulled the same way,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2985,,213,the student's data shows that the plastic types are stretchable. two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by writing its first starting length and for another improvement they could have one a third trial to rest if their experiment is true,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
2986,,213,the plastic that the most stretchability is plastic be probably due to the fact that all of the polymer links are parallel to each other and it stretched an average of 22-23mm. 2 ways that this could have been improved is having a ord trial and using the same length for each sheet or plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
2987,,213,aplastic type i was able to stretch farther so based on that result i conclude it was able to withstand more weight.^p (b)two ways the student could of improved the validity of the result are use the same size of plastic for all trials and types and add another trial to combine results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666

3024,,213,the two ways the student could have improved experimental design outfor validity of the results are.procedure:4) add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.if you do that you doing to know plastics is strong and can carry a have thing i remove the weight and camp and measure the length of the plastic types after you remove the weights and could how many weight they can early stuff in the plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3025,,213,a conclusion drawn is that the results were fully accurate and had little change during the second trial the students could have included a diagram to give a better picture of how the experiment should look like and a good info and results have at least 3 trials so the students should have done another trial and drawn a diagram,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3026,,213,based on the student's data plastic type i was consistently the stretches of all the plastic types used in the experiment one possible validity issue is the description of the weights added to the clamp in each trial the procedure does not tell in how much weight must be applied and thus a person may apply uneven amounts of weight depending on the trial and plastic this would cause the experiment to have the uniformity of its data in the fact that the weight was not constant also the student could have improved the experimental design by adding more trials to the experiment and in turn gaining more data to make the results more accurate,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3027,,213,according to the data table it looks like the plastic type i was stretched the most and plastic a was stretched the best be one way the experiment could have improved is if they said what the measurement of the plastic was before the weights were on it another thing is they have said how much the weight was that hung on the plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3028,,213,based on the data shown plastic type do seems to be the most durable the table shows that it did not stretch the student could have improved validity by doing more trials and repeating the experiment more than once incase any error wes made during the first run through of the test,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333

3075,,213,based on these results plastic type i and i stretch the most but of the four plastics while plastics a and i sustain their shape much better the student could have improved the design of this experiment by setting on exact weight being added to the plastics and by completing one more trial to make a total of three trials,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3076,,213,"a plastic i was the one with the most stretchability, plastic i came next followed by plastic i then a up be the student could have included how much the weights weighed this would make the experiment valid when reproduced up also they could have included the initial length of the plastic before it was stretched",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3077,,213,based on the student's data i can conclude that plastic i is more flexible this is because for each trial it stretched the most on the other hands plastic a stretched the least because it only stretched comm and 12 my while i stretched comm and 23mm. up to improve the validity of the results the student could have done a third or even fourth trial this additional data will make the results clearer also the student should state how much the weights weigh so that others can perform his experiment and get similar results he might have also wanted to include how long the pieces of plastic were originally,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3078,,213,a based on the students data you can conclude that plastic type i has the most stretchability. up be one thing the student could have done top improve their experimental design would have been to tell how much weight to put on the clamps they also could have said which side to clamp because edge could mean left right or anything,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3079,,213,one conclusion it can draw based on the student's data is that plastic type i is stretched much more ammo than the other three types maintaining the amount of 20 my in both trials based on the data plastic type a is less flexible stretch comm in the first trial an 12 in the second trial the student could have stated that they started out with unused plastics and record their initial stretch,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3080,,213,a conclusion to data is that plastic type i is able to stretch the furthest out of the rest of the plastic types the student could have improved the design by adding another trial to all plastic types & also by altering the plastic to hang longer,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3081,,213,"according to the graph,plastic type i was the plastic that was stretched when plastic that was stretched when plastic type a did not stretch as much clearly type a is more durable and sturdy to improve the experimental design the students should have said what each of the starting weights put on the plastic were and do a third trial to make it as accurate as possible",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3082,,213,my conclusion would be that after only two trials plastic type i proved to be the most stretchible of those 4 plastics one way they could have improved was to do another trial another way is instead of only allowing five minutes they should of let hang until it was about to rip in then measure giving it maximum length,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3083,,213,a a conclusion from this data is that plastic sample i is the the most stretchable.^p be two ways that the student could have improved the validity of the results are making the plastic samples the same initial size and allowing the plastic samples to stretch for more than five minutes,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3084,,213,a from the students results i see that plastic i was the strongest stretching 23 mme plastic i was next stretching 20 mme plastic i was third stretching 14 mme lastly plastic a was the weakest stretching 12 mm.^p be two ways the students can improve their experiment is to do more trials for better results also they could increase the height of the table to avoid the results be tampered should the plastic stretch to the floor,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3085,,213,it can be concluded that plastic a is the strongest and most durable plastic it stretched significantly less then most other plastics with an average of comm plastic i would be the second best because it stretched an average of 13.5mm.followed by plastic i with comm stretched and lastly plastic i with 2205mm stretched the student could improve this experiment by adding a control and could be more valid by making sure each plastic was the same length,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3086,,213,the plastic from to stretched a little more than it did in the they could have made sure the plastic weights the same and the could of made sure the weights were all equal in each group,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3087,,213,a in conclusion to the results it can be said that polymer i is the most stretchy followed by do then ca then a the only problems is that you can't accurately judge it because you can't tell if they are all the same beginning length a conclusion would only work if they were the same starting length up be one way to improve the design would be to specify the beginning length of the polymer strips another would be to indicate the amount of weight attached to each polymer,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3088,,213,it seems that plastic a is the most strechable because it is the only one that stretched longer two ways that the students could improve the experiment is to name the different plastics also add heavier weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3089,,213,it can be recorded that above all others tested in the experiment plastic type i is the most stretchable. this is because at 22.5mm it had the largest amount stretched on average between the two trails or all other plastic types up two ways this experiment can be improved is to state the amount of weight used each trial with different weights being used results could have different from what they should have been also because the amount stretched is measured in such small increments millimeters more trials should be performed to enhance the data's accuracy,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3090,,213,aii conclusion all of the plastic stretched but plastic type i stretched the most in bath trials.^p.b) two ways the students could have improved their experiment design and or validity of the results arethe could have told how much weight to add to the plastics.they could have told the plastic pieces original length.those are two ways the students could have improved their experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3091,,213,a overall in this experiment trial 2 had stretched more than trial 7. up be try adding more weight to the plastic bags and let the weights hung on the bags for a longer period of time,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3092,,213,bathe conclusion is that all of the plastics stretched from 10 my - 23 mme plastic type a stretched the least and plastic type i type i stretched the most.^p bathe students could did a third trial or make a fourth trial they could added the temp and weights to the plastic types of the same time and then measured at the same time,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3093,,213,a the stretches of the four materials was be with the average stretching of 22.5mm's. up be the student could have made sure to cut all the plastic into even strips of the same length and width and second they could have performed another trial for each plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3094,,213,a you could tell that plastic type i would be the best plastic because it stretched the most with weights onto up be two ways the students could have improved were said how much the weights weighed also they could have done a second trial with heavier weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3095,,213,a conclusion based on the student's data would be that the plastics were other a little more or less stretchy the second time due to it being stretched out the first time one way the student could have improved the experiment design was by performing a third trial without weights another way would be to allow them to hand for about 10 minutes the ord time,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3096,,213,they can conclude that even after a second trial of stretching the plastics significantly didn't stretch to much larger than trial 1.,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3097,,213,3. in conclusion plastic type i stretched the most because during 11 it stretched comm and during 12 it stretched the least up the student could have improved the experiment design by adding more ways to stretch the plastic for example adding little heat the results could have simply been improved with a few more trials,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3098,,213,based on the students data it can conclude that plastic type i is the plastic with the most stretchability. two ways this experiment could have been improved is by adding more trials also adding the amount of weights and being specific about the length of each plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3099,,213,3. a plastic type i had stretched the most out of both of the trials up be added more trials more time for plastic to be hanging,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3100,,213,one conclusion that i can draw from this experiment is that plastic i stretched the most for both trials 2 ways to improve the validity would to be add a control no weight and see if it stretches and the size of the plastic sample just to make sure that every plastic is the same size to start,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3101,,213,a a conclusion that can be made from this data is that plastic type i has the most stretchability. this is because in both trials it stretched 22-23 my and that is more than any other plastic type tested up two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design was to make the weights used for every plastic sample constant also for the plastic samples the student could make sure to have the starting length fall the plastic types be the same and constant making as many aspects of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0

3106,,213,a i concluded that his club is valid based upon doing multiple trials i also noticed that the most stretchable was i and the least was app though two trials is good it is best to do a third trial or fourth trial would be best also i think that they should have measured the length of the plastic before and have it on the the data table to compare the changes the occurred in the plastics,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3107,,213,based on the student's data i is wrong because the first time is stretched comm then the second time is stretched 13 how is that possible the second trial should be more or equal if the used the same weight.^p be he could told us how much weight he used also be could have done another trial to be sure his data was right,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3108,,213,based on the students data i can say that plastic type i can stretch the most because in both trials plastic type i stretched atleast umm longer than the second highest plastic stretchability. to improve the experimental design the students could have said how much weight should be attached to the clamp and exactly what steps should be repeated in the second trial,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3109,,213,based on this students information i would say that the first 2 exceeded because they went up the second time this means it went farther but for the last too the went down or stayed the same a way the student could have improved was to make step 6 in the procedure more clear by saying what steps to repeat second way they could improved was by for step five put more steps because step 5 has like 3 steps in one,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0

3114,,213,a i conclude that plastic type a stretched the most(2ml). up to improve the experimental design andlor mostly of the results species the amount of weight added to the clamp and make all pieces of places for one uniform length,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3115,,213,i have come to the conclusion that plastic type i has the best stretching ability since the data shows it stretched 22 my and 23 mme the students could have improved the validity by making sure all the plastics starting length were the same also the weight added to the plastic should have stayed constant as well throughout all trials,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3116,,213,"in conclusion it can be said that plastic type i had the most amount stretched because its numbers in to (22)and to (23) were the highest also the plastic type that was more durable and was not stretched is much was plastic type a because its number in t1(10) was and to (12) were the lowest to improve this experiment,it would be better to include three trials and include the plastics type initial measurements to make the data table more specific and efficient",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3117,,213,based on the data table plastic type i stretched the most in the 15 minutes with the amount stretched for i 1 was comm and for to -23mm. so type i had the most stretchability up 2 ways the students could have improved their experiment would be labeling the type of plastic they were using instead of putting plastic type a be ca and do and another way they could've improved their experiment would be trout how many weights they clamped to the plastic for each plastic so we can see how far the plastics stretched and how many weights were used,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3118,,213,one way the students can improve there experiment is to do a other trial to see if they missed anything,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3119,,213,a based on the students data plastic type i is the weakest plastic out of them all and the strongest polymer plastic is plastic a because it was stretched the least up be the students could've included more description on the plastic like each plastics length or width in order to show that everything was the same in length and width also the students should include in procedure on how many weights they used,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3120,,213,a passed on the results plastic i is the most stretchy and a is the least the order is from most hotel to least i i i a up be the student could of improved experimental design by being more specific he could change bottom edge in step 3 to edge of the side of the table additionally he could give us the weight of the clamp weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3121,,213,"my conclusion from the data presented is plastic type i and i through i and i increased higher but i stays constant at 20, those were only with two trials the student should have done more trials and should have stated the length of the paper",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3122,,213,a conclusion that can be made based on the data is that plastic type a is the strongest this is ture because plastic a stretched the least about on average two ways that the students could have improved their lab is by saying how long the types of plastic should be and saying how many weights should be added to the clamp and how many weights should be added to the clamp because there could have been an error when the plastics were different lengths with different amounts of weights and this would make the data inaccurate,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3123,,213,i conclude that plastic i stretched the most but plastic i was constant he could have added more that's he should use brand new plastic so the test would be accurate,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3124,,213,a the stretches kind of plastic was type be because it stretched the most.^p up be the student could have given the weights and the original length of the plastic in the procedure and made sure they were constant,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3125,,213,based on the students data it is possible to see how much each type of plastic stretched but not how much weight was needed to stretch it that far as the original length of the plastic up two ways the student could have improved the experiment are to make a more detailed procedure include the weight of the type of plastic planes instructions etc and too create a clearer table that includes the types of plastic the original length and the weight added,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3126,,213,plastic type i stretched the most in both trials one and two plastic type a stretched the least in both of the trials.^p the students could have improved the experiment design by conduction more trials and so stating how many weights they added on top of the clamps the results werent valid,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3127,,213,a based on the data the most stretchable plastic was plastic i bac it stretched 22 my on the first trial and 23 my on the second trail also the least stretchable plastic was plastic a bac it only stretched in during to _ 12 during the plastic i stretched only a bit more than plastic a plastic i stretched 20 mom's both times making it the and most stretchable out of the 4.,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3128,,213,a my hypothesis was correct plastic type a stretched the least during the experiment i noticed that the plastic that stretched the least was most commonly used in our town to hold the heaviest items up be to improve the validabil of the experiment the students should have used a specific amount of each plastic not just a sample's also the students should have stretched the plastic across a gap and placed weights on top this would have shown a more accurate assessment compared to the actual used,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3129,,213,based on the students data it is concluded that their wasn't much stretchability from the plastic samples sample a increased umm from to to the sample i increased umm from to to the sample i decreased by umm from to to the sample i stayed the same in to and the this experiment could be improved if the student had a control which would be the measure of each plastic sample without any weight added.they could also repeat the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3130,,213,a plastic i was the most stretchy it was comm in the first trial in the second trial it stretched 1 more millimeter the second most stretchy polymer was plastic i i remained at comm both trials up be the students could have improved the experimental design validity of the results by i specifying the amount of weight added in the experiment and 2. they could have tried different ways of testing the stretchability there how using weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3131,,213,out of all the polymer plastics type a stretched a total of 2 my as the best one up to have a control and to make sure to tell us how long the plastic is,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3132,,213,"a in this experiment,it can be concluded that plastic i had the most stretchability with comm in trial 1 and comm in trial 2. also i can conclude that plastic a of the polymer plastics stretched the least with an average of him overall then plastic i stretched an average of comm and plastic i stretched 20mm^p two ways to improve this experiment would have been to make sure each plastic is exactly the same length as the add to the end of the plastic they could also add a ord trial to make the experiment more valid",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3133,,213,a in this data it shows how far different type of plastic can be stretched plastic type a was stretched umm within trial 1 and 2. plastic type i was stretched ammo lastly plastic type i was stretched ammo in conclusion plastic type a was the easiest to stretch up be two ways it could have been improved was a have more tests and what what type of plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3134,,213,through this data recorded from the experiment we can conclude that plastic a had the strongest polymer setup this is because it stretched the least throughout both trials one way this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents . for example the weights added to the clamp should have definitely been the same also to improve validity the student should have had the same starting length of plastics thing this,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3135,,213,a plastic type a was stretcher because on the first trial it stretched out to comm and in the second trial it stretched out to 12mm. it had stretched longer but plastic type i seems to have been stronger it only stretched comm through out both of the trials,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3136,,213,a i think that plastic i in both trials had the most weights out of the three other plastics from the student's data up be two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is one that the student could have done five trials instead of two to see the difference also instead of four plastics but five he or she could improve the statement too,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3137,,213,in conclusion in trial one plastic type i stretched the most while plastic type a was the lowest in trial two plastic type i stretched the furtherist. up measure the height of the table weigh the weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3138,,213,a plastic type i was able to hold the most weights for each trial up be two ways they could have improved the experiment or validity is doing more trials for each plastic or they could have let the plastic hang for longer than just 5 minutes,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3139,,213,"a based on the student data table ii can conclude that plastic types a is the strongest because it didn't stretch that far in the first trial it only stretch comm and in to it only strech 12, i can also conclude that plastic type i is the wakes because in both trial it strech 20mm. up bathe student could have improve the experiment either by leaving the weights on longer or by add more heavier weights",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3140,,213,based on this student's data the type with the most amount of stretching was plastic type i with comm and plastic a had the least with 10 the first trial and 12 the second the student could've conducted more trials as well as stated what the types of plastic were,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3141,,213,the plastic with the least stretch would be plastic a because it had a small change from comm to 12mm. two ways the student could have improved the experimental design andlor validity of the results are have the clamps and weights be the same ones overtime and make sure the plastic is on the side of the table not going on the top of the table,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3142,,213,a i concluded that plastic type i had the best stretchability and plastic type a had the least.^p be the student should have included in the procedure how many weight to put on the clamp and describe where on the bottom edge of the plastic to put the clamp,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3143,,213,in conclusion the students data show that when the plastic was stretch each material stretched only 1-2 mme this is not a very big change in length the data also showed that for one of the plastics after stretched lost a my of length so this was not a very succsecfull lab up one thing that they could do to improve this is to tell us what kind of plastic to use so the experiment is easier to test and also to have a control variable to really see the change in plastics,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3144,,213,my conclusion is that type i is the most stretchy based on the results the student should have improved this by doing it in even trials even thought other could be how put there's experiment on the table this would have improved the validity,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3145,,213,a type i plastic stretched the same amount in trial 1 and 2. it stretched 20mm. up be in the procedure the students can get rid of step 7 because step 6 basically states the same thing also they could have done three trials for more data,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3146,,213,in conclusion plastic i stretched more than all the other plastics two steady trials of comm each plastic type a & i both stretched a little more in trial 2 and plastic type i stretched less plastic type i stretched the most having stretched 22 then 23mm. up improve:(1). show in graph beginning length of plastic up (2) create a to and try it once more up (3) add another 3 trials with different weight,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3147,,213,in conclusion plastic type i is the most polymer for stretchability because in both trials it erected the most making it the most stretched out of the all other polymers.^p two ways the student could have improved is by saying which plastics the students used for each so the people would know if the data is correct and by saying how much weight was used to stretch the plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666

3149,,213,a plastic type i can be stretched the farthest up be -1) the students could have specified how heavy the weights were up i they could've let the plastic hang for more than 5 minutes,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3150,,213,a conclusion could be that plastic type i had the best results for strechability with him and 23m. to make the experiment more valid the group could have run more trials and they also could used more detail in the procedure like stated how heavy the weights were,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3151,,213,i think that the data they have is correct but it shows that plastic type a is the only one that has a lower trial than the other types two ways the students could have improved the experiment was to tell how heavy the weights were and what plastic was used,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3152,,213,a in conclusion plastic i and i have more stretchability than a and i because plastics i and i stretched an average of comm while plastics a and i stretched an average of 12mm. up be two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to do more trials and to add a control,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3153,,213,based on the student's data it is easy to conclude that plastic type i was the most constant through both trials with a measurement of 20 mme the student's though could have improved their experiment by doing more trials and by also being more specific for example saying what types of plastic they used instead of saying a be i or do also they could have said how much weight was added so that it is clear and exact,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3154,,213,a in conclusion based on the student's data polymer plastic i stretch the most in both trials done & the least that stretch both trials was type a leaving us to see i is the most stretchable from all for types up i she could have included a time limit for the plastic to dangle freely second she could have made a graph to have it be more visual,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3155,,213,based on the data we can tell that plastic type a stretches the least amount of all other types of plastic it only stretched an average of 11 my which was less than all others the students could improve their experiment by adding another trial this always verifies the validity of an experiment they could also verify how long the strip of plastic is and keep that constant throughout the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3156,,213,a conclusion draw is that trail 1 the plastic wasn't that strong to pull but trail 2 it went far and was stretched more plastic type i was the same in trail 1 and 2. the students could have improved the experimental design by maybe adding another trial to see what you get also they could have use different plastic for the trials,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3157,,213,based on the student's data plastic i stretched the same length for both trials two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to on the data table say how long each type of plastic is before the student started the experiment another way the student could of improved the experimental design would be to have done only one trial instead of two,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3158,,213,i cannot draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table the students could have improved the test by adding in the plastic length to the data table they also could have included the amount of weight the weights weight,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3159,,213,a the students wanted to see which plastic was mor strechibal. be two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by doing a ord trial say how far off the table,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666

3164,,213,the plastic type i stretched the most out of all the other plastic types two ways the student could have improved his experiment was i to include in his data table how much weight he used on the clamp i to include what the starting length of the plastic was in his data table,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3165,,213,the students wanted to determine in this experiment which type of plastic a i ca or i was able to stretch the most based on the data plastic i had the best stretchability and was able to stretch 22 my in the first trial and 23 my in the second trial the students could have conducted more trials to improve the validity of their results to improve their experimental design they could have been more specific and stated how many weights should be added to the plastics and to better control the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3166,,213,based on the data table i would say that plastic i was your strongest plastic because it didn't stretch one way they could of improved the experiment was to run a trial 3 to tell plastic do another way they could of improved the experiment is by adding many weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3167,,213,based on the students data the plastic i is the most strechable polymer plastic plastic a is the least strechable. this is because plastic i was stretched at comm just trial and comm and trial comparing it to the others it stretched the furthest plastic a only stretched comm just trial and comm and trial to improve this experiment the students should have had a control choosing a specific plastic they also should have done one more trial to ensure validity three trials can help make this definite,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3168,,213,in conclusion the plastics stretched more during the second trial than the first.the second trial the first the second trial all plastics stretched further except for type i and i which did not change two ways to make this better would have been to do a third trial and to specify how much the weights were,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3169,,213,"a based on the students data plastic type i stretched the most at an average of 22.3mm, while plastic a stretched a mere comm average plastic i stretched the second most with an average of comm and then plastic with 13.5 average mme the average in stretchability is due to the different chemical composites of each plastic up be the student could have improved the validity and design by recording how much weight was used which would allow someone to replicate the experiment and recording the percentage stretched rather than just how much a sample that is 10cm but stretched comm is a much more significant change than one that is 10 meters and stretched 10mm, but the data table fails to recognize that",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3170,,213,in conclusion all the plastic types are all different amount stretched the plastic stretching out in trials 1-2 are going up and down up the student could have improved by doing a third trial to show more of the results explain why they added more weight,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3171,,213,based on the students data i can conclude that plastic type a was the strongest because it stretched the least amount up be for the student to improve the experimental design they could have written how much weight the put on the plastics and to improve the validity they should have done a third trial,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0

3179,,213,"a the students could have concluded that plastic type i has the largest amount of stretchability, because type i stretched 22 min in trial one and 23 my in trial 2. up be the students could have improved the validity of their experiment by 1. doing more trials to collect more data 2. allow the clamps with the weights to hang longer than 5 mind",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3180,,213,a a conclusion that can be brought from the data is that plastic type i is the best type of plastic fore stretchability because it stretched comm and comm on it's trials up be two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by having or stating that the plastics all had the same initial measurements also the student could have named the type of plastics the validity can be questioned because it is unknown if they were the same length to begin with and the plastic is unknown,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3181,,213,based on the students data plastic i stretches more than the other plastics the students could improve this experiment by checking the temperature of the room because plastic's elasticity varies on the temperature another improvement would be to measure the amount of weight that is being put into each bag,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3182,,213,the data shows the plastic for stretching more in be because maybe the put or did different procedure but experiment i have the same type of stretching the procedure are the same or maybe he did it three times the students have to do the procedure they have to do the experiment like three time as or more the need to have all the materials and put it in order the need to have his own question find his conclusion,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666

3205,,213,a plastic type i has shown to be the most stretchable polymer plastic by stretching about 23 mme up be one way the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing more trials another way would be writting down how many weights they added to each plastic type,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3206,,213,each plastic type had stretched about 1-2 millimeters as where type i did not stretch much therefore the type i plastic was the strongest.^p two ways the students should have improved there experimental design would be not to use the same plastic each trial do it three times instead of two and include the length from floor to table,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3207,,213,a based on the students data plastic type a had the strongest resistance against weight and therefore makes it stronger than the rest because plastic a stretched 10-12mm while plastic i stretched 22-23mm. up be the students should have had the same size plastic strips for each type a third and an averaged measurement for each plastic would make the data even more valid,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3208,,213,a plastic type i stretched the most while plastic type a stretched the least this shows that plastic type i have less cross linking of its polymers while plastic a had the greatest amount of cross linking up be one way the students could have improved their experiment could be add another trial to get a bigger range to make sure the data is accurate another way the students could have improved their experiment is by adding more plastic types for a longer sample size,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3209,,213,3.a. the students experiment was a good experiment because ( they had 4 different plastic types they had two trials to check and reached for experiment up be they could have had more trials they should had more plastic types,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3210,,213,a based on the data as you see different type of plastic they would be different or the same on both trials for example plastic type a first trial is werent stretchable and when you repeat it again it would change up be two ways to make it better was have more different plastics and maybe add more weight to the clamp to see what changes,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3211,,213,a my conclusion according to the data would be that plastic i stretched the most up be some ways the students could improve their experiment is if they said how much weights was on the plastics also they should of not have done the second trial exactly the same as the first cause there would be no difference so the data should be the same as the first because the second trial was supposed to be done exactly the same as the first,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666

3213,,213,a plastic type i was the polymer plastic with the greatest stretch length plastic type a was the most resistant to stretch be the students need to make a couple of changes to improve the validity of the results in step 1 of the procedure it says take a sample of one type of plastic i measure its length this is misleading because all 4 polymer plastics should be the same length at the beginning of the experiment this is important bac the longest should be the piece is at the beginning can affect how much it will stretch finally students need to change step 9 add some weights to a specific number of weight this is important bac if they put more weight on one plastic it will stretch farther than a plastic we less weight attached,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3214,,213,i guess when the plastic reaches a certain amount it will break up they should of used a different type of plastic to see how it works out,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3215,,213,in conclusion plastic a was the least stretched after two tries also plastic i was the most stretches after the two tries the student could have improved the experimental design by being more specific and also measured the length of the materials before doing the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3216,,213,based on the student's data i can conclude that plastic type i is the strongest for example in trial 1 it stretched 22 my and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mme up two ways the students could have improved the experimental design are adding another trial and increase the amount of time it hangs,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3217,,213,aplastic type i is more flexible and stronger some plasticstretch more after the first trial like 10mm-12mm^p be i think having more trials so his data can be more precise and having a patrol,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3218,,213,plastic type i is the stretches while type a is the least stretchy two ways they could improve the experiment is by adding more trials and check to make sure all other variables are constant such as temperature,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3219,,213,plastic type i stretched more than all other plastic types.^p one way the experiment could have been improved is if they kept on adding weights until the plastic broke and measured how much weight it can hold another way is of putting one plastic on top of another and add the weight and see if that changes how far one on the plastic stretches,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3220,,213,the students conclusion was not much because there was many types of plastics to choose from up the students could have improved the experiment if the student picked a certain type of plastic not any type other reason is that they not the weights in the same spot in trial 1 and trial 2.,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3221,,213,a in conclusion of this experiment plastic type i seemed to stretch the most in both trials of the experiment also it seems as if plastic type a was the stacking in the experiment as it only stretched a half the amount of plastic type a up be instead of add weights they could have given a specific amount of time they also could have given the original lengths of each plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3222,,213,a based on our results we can conclude that plastic i was the weakest because it stretched the most plastic a was the strongest because it stretched the least up be they could have mentioned more contents such as the weight they put on the bag sample every trial up they should have had a control atrial where no weights were added,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666

3234,,213,based on this student's results i can conclude that the most stretchable plastic is type be type i plastic stretched 22 my the first trial and 23 my the second trial some thing that could have been done to improve the validity of the experiment would be to do a third trial in an experiment can make the results more accurate depending on the amount of trials there are in your experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3235,,213,the data shows that the plastic types stretched about the same in both trials in the procedures the student must say which she is recording the data i think the data would have a better conclusion if the student did another trial for each different plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3236,,213,a the order from the most stretchable to the lest strechable is plastic types i first i second i third and a last plastic type i stretched the furthest at comm est trail and comm the second trial a was the least strechability and stretched comm est trail and comm the second up be the student could have done more trails or they could have let it hand longer,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3237,,213,a in conclusion based on the students data the plastic samples stretched slightly more in the second trial plastic type i was the only plastic that kept its length constant be to improve the validity of the results i would've measured the plastic's width to improve the design i would've used a fifth plastic type to expand my results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3238,,213,the plastic that were being stretched all come out to a different length on the second trial of stretching the some plastics someway the numbers would sorely the some give or take a few the student could have improved the experiment by leaving the plastic to stretch larger and see if there is a different results also the student doesn't know if each type of plastic is the exact same so the strength could have varied and changed the whole experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3239,,213,the polymer type i had the greatest stretchability because its average amount stretched was the greatest at 22.5mm stretched average it was higher than type des comm average.types a and i were less stretchable than type i by 11.5mm and umm respectively the variability of the results could be increased by the reading the amount of trials this way the averages would be closer to what they should be the design also could be improved by starting the weight of the weights 2000kg and 200g would be a kings difference on results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3240,,213,to test four different polymer for stretchability the student would need to record the data from the investigation to procedure and perform a second trial exactly just like the first trial two ways a student could improve the experimental design and the validity of the result is first off could try two more test trials to see if the plastic type and amount stretched can be improved second off could use the conclusion to help out with the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3241,,213,"in conclusion the strongest plastic that held up is plastic type be in trail one was stated comm and trail two was 23mm, while plastic type a got comm for the first trail and comm for the second trail so over all the plastics type i is the one that can hold up the longest and is more durable one way this lab could do is to add more trails then another improvement could be to explain elly in the produce to get three more bags",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333

3275,,213,in conclusion plastic type i has the most stretchability. also plastic type a has the least stretchability. the student could have had another trial,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3276,,213,based on the student's data you can draw a conclusion that plastic type i stretched the farthest amount one way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by adding more trials another way would be by controlling the measurement of the plastic and weights so each are the same,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3277,,213,most plastics stretched 1 to 2 inches longer one didn't stretch at all and another actually become shorter i think this data is wrong when you tape the plastic tape an inch on the table then add the inch to the final results they should also put a certain amount of weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3278,,213,in conclusion out of the 4 tested polymer plastics plastic type i proved to have the best stretchability because it stretched 22 my during to and 23 my during the one way the students could've improved their experiment is to perform a ord trial so results can be proved to be more reliable a second way they can improve is to run a trial where the plastics hold weights for maybe 10 minutes so they could conclude if maybe some plastics would break in the process of being stretched,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3279,,213,one way the students could have improved the experimental design is to add how much weight they were putting on the plastics another way they could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3280,,213,based on the data i would conclude that plastic type i stretched the most as it had an average of 22.5 my stretched one way the student could have improved his experiment design would have been to add another trial so that the results would have been more valid the to more results to a range another way the student could have improved his experiment would have been to give a specific mass for the weights attached to the plastic so that other people can do the experiment and get the same results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3281,,213,the conclusion that can be drawn from the label is that the second trial was more successful at being stretched out two ways that the students could of improved the design of the results are increasing the amount of time the plastic was stretched also hey could of changed the amount weight was on the clamp to to me it would be also helpful if a control was run to compare results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3282,,213,a from the given results one can conclude that plastic type i is the stretches type out of the four that were tested up be however there are same ways that the validity of this experiment could be improved one improvement could be to specify the original length of the plastic if the sizes vary the data found is useless incomparable another improvement to this experiment could be to perform more trials you can not obtain consistency a needed ingredient in an ideal experiment in only two trials,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3283,,213,akin conclusion the plastic type i stretched the most compared to any other plastic.^p be one way the experiment could be improved would be to keep the length of the given plastic equal another improvement would live to add the same amount if weight to each plastic and lot the weight the procedure,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3284,,213,a in conclusion after five minutes the plastic types were stretched longer for plastics a and be plastic i decreased in trial i and plastic i stayed the same.^p be two ways the student could have improved the experiment are 1. added or decreased the weights amount in trial 2.2. let the weights hang for longer/shorter amount of time,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3285,,213,the student should have wrote the weight of the structure the color and more about the size,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0

3287,,213,"a the plastic type i was the stretches and a was the least stretchy up be one way this experiment design could be improved is have multiple times recording the stretch length like i 10, 15 minutes the other way is adding more weights",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3288,,213,i concluded that plastic type i was the most stretchable. up one way they could improved this experiment was by completing three or more trials up a second way they could improve this experiment is to limit the weights they put on the plastics then have it go up as a whole,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3289,,213,in the experiment plastic type i stretched the most with 222-23mm in length type a stretched least with 10-12mm in stretching i stretched the second least (14-13mm) and i closely followed i (20mm in stretching it is very clear that plastic type i has the most stretchability and type a has the least to improve this experiment one could designate how much weight should be applied to the clamp for each repeating of procedure on each of the four plastics also a control group could be added,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3290,,213,a conclusion i can draw from this experiment is that the second trial (t2) had increased the amount of plastic stretched all expert plastic type i which removed the same two ways the students could have improved the experimental designs was by measuring the weights for each clamp and another way was to have a third trial,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3291,,213,a conclusion could be that different plastics have different amounts that it could be stretched at the student could have improved the experimental design by having 3 trials an variety of cups,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3292,,213,a plastic type i stretched the most during both trials of this experiment up be first the student should have used the same length of each plastic finally the student should make sure each type of plastic is hanging the same length off the table,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3293,,213,the conclusion drawn from the data would be that plastic type i stretches the most because it was the longest length after being stretched the student could improve the experiment by adding more trials to get more data to drawn make accurate conclusion from the student could also cut the plastic to the same starting length in order to ensure that they all have the same start and the results would be more accurate,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3294,,213,a the whole procedure worked out well i think the results came out to be almost the same when they repeated it.^p be i think the student should have did a third trial also i think he should have chase two different plastics to see how each one does with clamps hanging from them on the table,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3295,,213,in conclusion to the polymer investigation lab it is clearly known that plastic type i was the most stretchable while plastic type a was the least according to the data collected to improve the experiment the lab testers should have made sure that the plastic were all at the same length at the stare and recorded it also they should've made sure they used the same weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3296,,213,"in conclusion the polymer plastic that was the most stretchable, according to our experiments data was plastic type a (10mm-12mm). the polymer plastic that we found to be the least stretchable was plastic i which actually shrank it went from comm to 13 mme plastic i stretched umm and plastic i was impervious to the weight and didn't change a couple of ways the students can improve this experiment would be to at more trials to increase the validity and they can specify the actual weight that they used for the experiment",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3297,,213,"a in conclusion it seems that plastic i has stretched the most because the highest it stretched is comm and all the others we lower at 12,14 and 20mm.^p be one way the student could have improved their experiment is to tell in the procedure how long to cut the plastic so they all start at the same size therefore these results are not valid because we don't know if they were on even length when they started",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3298,,213,a plastic type i stretched the most in both to and the up be the students could have improved by stretching it differently in different ways that way you can see better as to which i stretches the best another way it could have improved would be by it saying to do things in the same place with the same measurements,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3299,,213,a the data that the students recorded is incorrect up be two ways the students could have improve the experiment by adding a control and by adding another performance trial to the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3300,,213,after looking at the data it showed that plastic type i stretched the most at 22 mm(t1) and 23 mm(t2). two ways the experiment could have been improved could be to tell us the types of plastics and their starting lengths also to specify the amount of weight thats put or in step four,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3301,,213,a the conclusion i drew based on the student's data is that plastic type i stretches the most.^p be two ways the student can improve the design and validity at the results is to state how much weight you add every five minutes and what types of plastics were used for this experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3302,,213,when looking at the students data i can conclude that plastic type a had the least stretchability reaching (10-12)mm. on the other hand plastic type i had the greatest amount of stretchability reaching (22-23)mm. two ways the student could improve his experiment design is 1 he could have used a control to have a more controlled experiment 2 he could have done each plastic type with more intervals such as 10 minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes and so on this would increase the validity of the results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3303,,213,the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results by 1. having all plastic pieces be the same length 2. add the exact amount of weights to each new point of plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3304,,213,based on the students data i conclude that plastic type i has the greatest ability to stretch the students could have improved their design by specifying the mass of the weights attached so the experiment can be repeated and they could have done more trials so they could have more confidence in their results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0

3306,,213,a 1 after looking at the students data their conclusion may be plastic type ''b'' stretches as the most because in to stretched 22 my and on to it got 23. comparing with the other plastic type which they lower tan 22 and 23. up be two ways the students could improved their experimental design are up i do it again up i compare their results with another group,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3307,,213,abased on the students data it can be concluded that plastic type i stretched the farthest it stretch comm in to and comm in t2.^p two ways to improve the validity are to say how many pounds the weights are and to state the exact name of the plastics and not just bathe them a be ca and do this would make the experiment more accurate,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3308,,213,a the students data shows that polymers i & i were the stretches while the plastic types a & i were not that flexible be the student could have improved higher experimental design by using a control which herthe can compare the results to a plastic used the student may also perform more trials in order to get an average amount stretched (mm).,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3309,,213,i say that type i plastic would work the best because it stretches more one way the students could have made their experiment is could have used specific type of weights ( we didn't know the weight of them they could have also repeated the trials,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3310,,213,a it is evident that polymer i had the longest growth in length from start to finish in both trials it is ultimately the most flexible/stretchable substance out of the 4 given in the experiment up be i the polymer should be attached with a sturdier applicant than tape up 2.) the amount of added weight should be specified,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3311,,213,a in conclusion i think that the plastic type be stretched the most and plastic a is the least stretchable. up be two ways the students could have improve the experiment was by one telling us what type of plastic to used and two telling us how fare to hang it of the table,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3312,,213,"a conclusion that can be drawn from the data is plastic i is the strongest tape out of the other 3 plastics (t1-t2, t2-t3) plastic i was the second strongest and plastic a was the weakest plastic and the second weakest was plastic ca two way the student could have improved the experiment is by using tighter tape for tying the plastic and act the 4 top plastic types in the wand",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3313,,213,based on the data i can conclude that plastic type i is the strongest of the four types tested in order to improve experimental design or validity of the results the student could have specified and exact number or weights added to the clam and the kind or weights and exact weight that he was adding to each piece of plastic also he could have measured each piece or plastic exactly the same in order to be more precise,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3314,,213,a based on the students data plastic i is the most stretchability and plastic a is the less stretchable plastic up be in the students experiment they could of stated exactly what was the measurement of the first type of plastic so they can repeat it accurately for the other plastics they could of also deemed the exact weigh of the clamp and how much wished the lights they add to get an more accepted result for the stretchability of the plastics,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3315,,213,the conclusion is there might have been some problems in the student's experiment some validity issues could be that the five minutes the weights and clamps that had to hang could have not been a fuller exact 5 minutes also the spot were the plastics were placed could not have been the same spot every time,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3316,,213,a a conclusion that can be drawn based on this data is plastic type i has a higher stretchability than the other types of plastics the independent variable is the type of plastic the dependant variable is how far it can be stretched up bathe ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to actually name the plastics and to tell us what the actual length was in the beginning by telling us the name we could replicate this experiment better by telling the length of the plastic in the beginning we could see the change that occurred,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3317,,213,a the conclusion of this experiment was to find the stretchability of different plastics in the data results i found that plastic type i has the most stetchability of the four plastics in both trial i and trial 2. up be what were the weight of the weights that were used how long was the length of the string that was attached to the weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3318,,213,based on the results plastic a is the least stretchable and plastic i is the most stretchable. the students could improve the experiment by giving the exact amount of weight to be used so that the experiment can be redone it needed the student could also make each plastic sample the same starting length to rule out length as a variable,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3319,,213,my hypothesis was correct the second trial didn't stretch the plastics further than the first trial up one way the student could have improved the experiment would be describing the length of the plastics before being stretched second the student could have also allowed the plastics to hang for a longer period of time to gather more accurate results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3320,,213,based on the following data on the polymer investigation i can make a conclusion that the plastic i type is the most stretchy also the trials very similar but only average by 12 my because the stretchyness. either increased or decreased if a student were to complete this experiment all over again i would suggest that they change the way they set up the experiment because it was very complicated which leads to many errors the students should also test the experiment 2 more times to see a range of results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3321,,213,the conclusion that i have drawn from this experiment is that plastic type i was able to stretch the most one way the student could have improved this experiment would have been they could have done a third trial to ensure the validity of the plastics strechability. the student also could have been more specific in their procedure they should have specified the plastic type to use in step one and say what measurement type to use in their experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3322,,213,a based on the data it seems type is amount stretched is the same the other plastic types stretched differently on both trials up be the students could run more trials to get a good result and they could measure the plastic after they put the clamps on the plastic and before they put the weights on,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3323,,213,what the data table shows is that plastic type a and i stretched additional length in trial second trial plastic i stretched length in trial two and i didn't stretch farther in trial two then one.^p (b)they can increase the number of trials for those experiment furthermore they should give the exact amount of the weight the use for experiment using grams,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3324,,213,based on this data i can conclude that plastic top i was the most stretchable at comm the first trial and 23 my the second trial one way to improve the validity is to have more trials minimum 3. and another way to improve the validity is instead of timing you should see how much weight it can hold before breaking by adding more weight at intervals,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3325,,213,based on the students data i can examine that plastic type i was prefarrened correctly because the 2 trials recorded the same length but plastic type i stretched farthest two ways the student could improve the experimental designer validity is to create more trials to test the stretch and also state the weight size and make sure he put the exact weight measure for each plastic type and trial tested,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3326,,213,"according to the data shown plastic type i was the strongest and plastic type a was the least strongest the groups experimental design would of been positively improved if they include what plastic they were using instead of saying "" one type of plastic "" if the group included the original length of the plastic it would of much both their experiment and validity better",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3327,,213,based on the student data it shows that to and to are showing that most of the experiments change on the second trial and a couple stayed the same as the first trial up the students could have improved their experiment by listing what the type of plastic is on the graph they also showed have weighed each weight to make sure they are all the same they also could have hung the lights from the same distance on the plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3328,,213,a plastic a stretched out the most with 2 mme be the student could have had another trial to test validity and also have started out with the same length for every plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3329,,213,a based on the table below i can infer that to stretched out more than the up be two way the student could have moral there exerimanta is is one thy could have gave how long the plastic was befor they stretched it so i can now the amount of the length stretched another thing word have to be is what they taped it the should of have used something more stronger lile another clamp for both end of the plastic and on each end,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3330,,213,"the sample of plastic a stretch the least meaning it was the strongest the sample of plastic i stretch the most meaning it was the weakest up the student could have improve the experiment by having a control sample plastic a,b,c, and do with no added weights another way to improve this experiment would be to have more trials for each kind of plastic",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3331,,213,in conclusion plastic type a and i did stretch but plastic type i got smaller and plastic type i stayed the same up the student could have found another way to stretch the plastics their data could have been put clearer also,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3332,,213,"in conclusion what all of the plastic type (a,b,c,d) stretched at least a millimeter per trial two ways the student could have improved the experiment was to have a controlled sample for each type plastic before they were stretched and the student should have been more specific about what type of plastic they used",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3333,,213,a conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type i was stretched the most two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to vary the weights and amounts placed on the plastic and to vary the time for the trials,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3334,,213,based on the students data i can conclude that plastic type i is the most stretchable and sturdy polymer just because it stretched more than any of other plastic types in both trials two ways the students could have improved the experimental design andlor validity of the results would be by including in the procedure the size of the weights used and the names of the different plastics incase another student wanted to replicate this experiment also herthe could have told us the starting size of the sample plastic prior to it being stretched,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3335,,213,a plastic type do had the most stretchability compared to the other plastics tested up be they should have been more specific about their mass go of the weights used they should have also stated how long their plastic samples were at the beginning of the experiment and how long after they were stretched,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3336,,213,conclusion plastics bad stretch significantly more than plastics act the students could have improved their design by starting with plastics of all the same length they also should named a common value for all the weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3337,,213,a that substance i stretched the fastest and then do then i and finally a would stretch the least amount up be the student could have given the original length of the plastics the student could have specified how much the clamp and the weighs weighed,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3338,,213,a from this data it can be concluded that plastic type i is the most flexible because it has the longest length stretched in both trial 1 and 2 additionally plastic type a is the least flexible since it had the shortest length stretched in both trials be one way the experimental design could be improved is by adding more trials for each plastic because more trials lead to more accurate results additionally the design could show how much weight is used on each plastic because if the weights are not the same for each plastic and trial the results are clearly not valid,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3339,,213,in conclusion type a is the strongest plastic and type i is the weakest plastic up in this experiment they should have more trials than just 2. up they also should have put how much weight they used and if it was the same amount of weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3340,,213,the conclusion that was drawn was that plastic type a had the longest length after being stretched with weights the students could have improved the experiment by having more than two trials and also by being more specific about the amount of weights that were used,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3341,,213,plastic type i is the most durable it had the most amount stretched the student should have wrote in the measurements of the before stretched length and how many weights to add when stretched,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3342,,213,a based on the results plastic type a was the least flexible while plastic type i was the most flexible up be i the student doesn't say where on the table to tape the tap edge of the sample i the student uses samples with varying length therefore making his results invalid,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3343,,213,my conclusion is that plastic type i stretch the farthest than the others two ways could of improved their experiments is adding more trials and adding weights to the bags,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3344,,213,according to the data plastic i seems to have stretched the most while plastic a stretched the least up the experiment could be improved in two ways the plastics length was not constant and will affect the results the plastics should be a set length the weight of the weights should be specified so that others may similarly recreate the procedure,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3345,,213,a conclusion i can draw based on the start ends data is that plastic type i had stretched the most at the end of both trials also i can draw the conclusion that type a stretched the least after both trials 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment or validity of the results are to control variables and perform more trials they could have improved the experiment by controlling the number of weights type of clamp and the height that the plastic hung from,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3346,,213,"a one conclusion that can be made is that the strongest plastic is a because it stretched the least in both trials be one way the students could have improved this experiment would have been to also test a control this experiment needs something to compare to or else the results are not totally valid something else the students could fix is to be more specific in this procedure most of the procedure is very vague it would be quite different to try to re-perform this experiment with this procedure for example the procedure says "" add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes the reader does not know the weight or size of the weights her does he know where to put them",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3347,,213,a the conclusion has been drawn that plastic type i stretches the most.^p be two ways to improve this experiment would be be tell how long to cut each plastic and how heavy the weights should be,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3348,,213,i conclude that plastic type because the strongest because it was the strongest the first and second trail up they could have made none trails and add more weights on the plastic see how had it works,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3349,,213,based on the students data i ca i say that plastic a was the strongest because it barely stretched two ways in which the experimental design validity of the results could have been improved were to label the plastics and in put the length of the plastic before it was stretched,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3350,,213,a plastic type i stretched the most out of all the plastics therefore plastic type i is the weakest up be two ways the students could have improved their experiment is clamp how much weight is put on to the clamps also they should do one more trial to make the experiment more accurate,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3351,,213,based upon the students data + displays that plastic type i is the most flexible compared to the other three types of plastic two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to do the standard 3 trials instead of two and also to further improve the student's avoiding of their results would be to record a before and after measurement as well as the averages to his table to make his more more clear or valid,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3352,,213,the plastic that stretched the most was be this student could improve by recording the amount of weight used and having the same amount of weight for each they could have also added the length of the plastics to show,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3353,,213,the conclusion i can draw from based on the student's data is that apb increased while i decreased and i stayed the same 2 ways the student could have improved the experiment is by est the way the decided to do the experiment they should have checked to see if after the est trial if it would go back to its normal form and they should have mentioned what the size was before the experiment was started,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333

3367,,213,a based on the students data it shows that plastic type i is the best choice because it stretched up to comm which is farther than the others up be the two ways that they can make the experiment better are adding more trials and adding more controls to make sure that everything is constant,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3368,,213,a when testing our hypothesis whe had came to a conclusion it seems to be that when we tested the plastic type by stretching it we had found out that when stretched a second time the numbers seemed to have went up and then on plastic type i it stood at 20. up be the students could have improved their experimental design if they would have told us what types of plastic they had used also they could have added how many times they did both trials,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0

3370,,213,plastic type i stretched the most but on the second trial plastic type a made the most difference to improve this project the student could have hung the plastic from a higher surface to see if gravity would stretch it more also the student could have put weights in the middle of the plastic to test if its middle would stretch more and be more durable,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3371,,213,based on the data plastic i is the most stretchable and plastic a is the least stretchable. up the students could have improved their experimental design and validity by attaching the clamp to the same place each time the also should have had a control which woud have been the plastic with the weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3372,,213,the plastic that stretched the most would be plastic type a because it went from 10 to 12 when the others increased by one or none at all the students could've tested more plastics or use a different method to strech the plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3373,,213,in conclusion according to the results of the experiment on the other hand plastic type a had the least amount of stretchability leaving plastic types i and i somewhere in between them two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be testing each plastic type one or two times for more reliability on the student could have tested more plastic types or added different weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3374,,213,a plastic type a had the most resistance it did not rip that much especially compared to plastic type be up be instead of letting them hang for 5 minutes make it less to be more effective,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3375,,213,my conclusion is that plastic type i is best because the amount stretched stayed the same throughout test trial 1 and test trial 2. two ways the students could have improved the experiment is allow the weights to hang longer than 5 minutes and or add a heavier weight,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0

3377,,213,according to the student's data plastic types i seems to be the most stretchable and plastic type a seems to be the most durable i think they should have done a third trial and specified a certain weight amount,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3378,,213,"a based on the data plastic material a was the most durable out of the four tested this is because plastic a only stretched comm on the first trial and 12 on the second while plastic i stretched 22 & 23mm, plastic i 14 and 13, and plastic i 20 each time this means that plastic a tolerated the weight on the clamp the best and also that plastic i tolerated it the least up be the students could have improved their experiment by using a variety of different weights to get a wider range of data and by doing more trials to allow for the most accurate data possible",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666

3397,,213,to improve the validity of the trial the student could add another trial for each of the plastic strips to improve the experimental design the student should mention the exact amount of the weights used on the plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3398,,213,based on the student's investigation i conclude that plastic types i and i are weaker polymers than plastic types a and ca both i and i stretched much farther than a and ca which indicates that their polymer chains are not as strong this student could improve the experimental design by using the same length of each sample to ensure that it is not a variable also the student cold have used a set number of weight to make sure each sample was stretched by exactly the same forces,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3399,,213,conclusion there was a small difference between the first and second trial for each plastic the student could have improved the validity by doing a third trial they could of improved the experimental design by stating how much each weighted weighed,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3400,,213,plastic i is the stretches plastic it stretched the most out of both trials than all the other plastics up the student could have specified what weight to used so each plastic is being pulled with by the same weight different weights would affect accuracy negatively the student also would have made sure the initials were of the same condition before being tested for example if a plastic was heated before the test it would stretch much more than a plastic that was cooled lastly the student could make sure each test was in same environment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3401,,213,be one thing they could've improved on would be the description on the steps explain it more with details another thing the students could work on would be to define the control up a polymer investigation,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3402,,213,a my conclusion is that plastic i was the stretchiest. up be to improve experimental design and validity the student should have specified how much weight he used to put on the ends of the clamps to stretch the plastic also there should have been a control to compare the results to at the end also there should have been a third trial so the experiment would be more valid,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0

3417,,213,a a conclusion that i can draw based on the students data is that plastic be stretches lot more then any of the other plastics and plastic a is the least stretchy i know that because plastic bus lowest trial was trial 1 with comm stretched which higher than any of the others on the data table also plastic ma's highest was in trial 2 at comm stretched and that the lowest on the board besides its own t1). as you can see the conclusion i drew and why it is an accurate one be two ways it could have been improved was by - doing 3 trials be the more trials the more accurate the experiment is and you've supposed to do 3. - he should have allowed the them to hang for more then 5 minutes in step 4. this way it will have more time to stretch,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3418,,213,based on the student's data the order of stretchability for the plastic types from greatest to least is be do ca a two ways the students could have improved the experimental design/validity of the results would've been to use the same clamp for all the experiments and to use the same amount of weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3419,,213,a conclusion i can draw is that plastic type i can be stretched the most at 22 mme plastic type a was the weakest stretched at 10 mme up two ways are do a control and do it for a longer time,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0

3422,,213,according to the data plastic type i was most likely a hard type of plastic such as a water bottle or milk jug because it didn't stretch at all two ways the student could have improved the experiment would be to add the constant of how much weight was added this is necessary so each plastic is being tested the same a second way to improve the experiment is to use the same amount of plastic to make each trial more valid and similar,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666

3459,,213,amour hypothesis was collect that plastic type would stretch the farthest because it is the most durable.^p bone way to improve their design was to add more to step seven like repeat steps 1-6 with new pieces of plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3460,,213,a a conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type i is the most stretchable whereas type a is the least and is more resiliant.^p be two ways to improve the validity include adding a third because the data is different in the first 2 and a third would confirm accuracy a little more also contracts should be outlined such as keeping the original plastic samples the same size before stretching specifying what ferments to go up by in weight added and specific amount of weight to add must be the same,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3461,,213,in the conclusion of the experiment plastic type i stretched the most to 22 my to 23 mme while i thought plastic type a stretched the least 10 & 12 mme two ways that these students can improve their experimental design would be having more variables controlled such as how much weight to put on to the clamps also the students got include the starting size of the plastics so it is hard to conclude any of their data,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3462,,213,a my conclusion in this experiment would be that plastic type i has the most stretchability out of all the polymers tested in both trials it had the most amount stretched trial 1 it was stretched comm and trial 2 was stretched 23mm. be the student could have improved the experimental design in two ways by having a control and by including constant variables the control would serve as a reference point to the rest of the data and constant variables would have made it so no other variables were affecting the results of the experiments,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3463,,213,i can conclude that plastic type i is the stretches because it stretched to 22 and 23mm. up the student could specify the amount of plastic that was hanging over the edge the student could also say how much weight he was using,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3464,,213,in conclusion plastic type i has the highest stretchability while type a has the lowest one way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to have a specific weight such as 1 be 2 be 3 be another way would be to add one more trial so as to prove or show better more valid results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3465,,213,one conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type i stretched the most (22 my and 23 mme out of all the plastics also plastic type a stretched the least only stretching to 10 my and 12 mme this is a conclusion that can be drawn up to improve the validity of the experiment the students could name the four plastics used also to have accurate data the kids should have set a measurement at which to cut all the plastics instead of saying measure its length''. also adding a control would be helpful as well this is how the students could improve the validity of their experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3466,,213,a conclusion that can be drawn from these student data could be that plastic type i appears to be the most reliable or stretch the most two ways these students could have improved their design is they could have done more trials and also they could have kept adding weights and see where plastic broke first and which held out the longest could have been the strongest,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3467,,213,my conclusion about the students data would be the farthest amount stretched he recorded one thing i would have done would be to change the plastic to which is more durable and add to so their can be more results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3468,,213,"a based on the data plastic type i stretched the most during trial 1 and trial i the least stretchable plastic was plastic type a type i was not very stretchable, and plastic i was the second most flexible up to ensure accuracy of the experiment up the student could have revealed the weight added to each plastic in the table to make sure that it was constant and also could have measured after a longer amount of time",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3469,,213,a based on the students data and the 2 trials the experiment seems to be very valid and accurate up be one way to improve this experiment i believe would be a third trial run only because plastic type a was umm away from the first trial which doesn't give you a great conclusion and another way i would change this would be explain better its very confusing and not specific how much were the weights etc,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3470,,213,if i look four plastic cups and taped them from the side of the table and place different contents such as weights then the plastic cups will stretch based on my results my hypothesis was correct because trial 1 and trial 2 shows that the plastic cups had stretched for example plastic type a stretched comm in trial after adding weights to the clamp and letting it hang for five minutes they could have improved the this experiment by giving the length of the cup before the cup and then they could have just measured it again and see what it was after for example before 30 after 40. they also could of improved this experiment by doing more trials to show the accuracy of the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666

3472,,213,in conclusion to this data i think plastic type i is the most flexible type of plastic also plastic type a is the least flexible up the students can improve their experiment by explaining how much of each plastic they should measure for example step 1 should say take him of one plastic type also they could improve it by adding the weight of the clamp and letting it sit for longer than 5 minutes,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3473,,213,after looking at the data i can conclude that plastic was i was the stronger the plastic because it stayed the same length up be two ways they could have improved the job is by first stating what type of plastic you are using and by saying how much weight you have to the clamp,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3474,,213,"from viewing data from me polymer investigation it shows that plastic type i truly has the most stretchability, because it stretched the most out of all the polymers at average of 22.5 mm.^p bathe experimental design would have better if adopt a trial i then the accuracy would go up another thing that you could have done was specified how much weight your adding and if its the same amount for all plastics",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0

3521,,213,abased on the data from the experiment the plastics that bell's the most was plastic i in the first trial it expanded 22 min 23 min in the second trial.b. this experiment is belong a control and needs more trials to improve the validity,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3522,,213,plastic type a had the most impact on stretching type i and i only stretch out one my longer & type a was the same.^p the student could have added more plastic types and let the weights clamps hang for a longer time,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3523,,213,we can conclude that plastic i is the plastic that can stretch the most we can also conclude that plastic a can stretch the least the student should haw used the same length plastic for each the student should have also made their data table it shows the plastic starting length and ending length,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3524,,213,"based on the students data i can draw a conclusion that at the end of expirment, plastic type a stretched the longest with ammo and type i stretched the least by remaining the same at 20mm. two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is first tell how much the weights weighed that he added to the clamp another way the experimental design could have been improved is by telling what kinds of plastic instead of using type abc and do",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3525,,213,a it is concluded that plastic type a had the most streachability because it increased umm in length from being stretched and all the others either grew smaller or barely stretched up i two ways this student could have improved the experimental design would be to have all the plastics beginning length the same and also specify how much weight to add to the plastic samples,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3526,,213,a based on the students data i can conclude that plastic type i had the highest amount of plastic stretched compared to the other up be two ways students could of improved this experiment is by doing materials to make results more reliable . also they should of had a control veritable of just the plastic so you can see the results on how far it has stretched,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3527,,213,based on the data collected by the experiment plastic type i has the greatest stretchability when attached to weights however there are ways in which this experiment could be improved the student did not specify how much weight or how many weights were added to the clamp herthe should write how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts also a third trial should have been conducted to formulate an average stretchability length only 2 measurements is not clear a third would allow the student to achieve an average length for each plastic making the numbers more simple to process,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3528,,213,plastic type i has more stretchability then plastics arc or do plastic i stretched on average of 22.5mm whereas a averaged it i averaged 13.5 and i averaged 20. the students should have specified the weight added and used that weight each time the students should also have started with the same size plastic and specified that length,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3529,,213,a a conclusion based on the student's data is that between each trail the number stayed the same or increased decreased by one.^p up be two ways the experiment could have improved is for the validity is to write down the my it started at and another way is to make sure when adding the weights they are the same found for each trail & plastic type,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3530,,213,according to the data plastic type i had the most stretchability of all them and plastic type a stretched the least each trial the students could've said what type of plastic it was and also stated the before and after numbers for the plastic just in case there were any errors in the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3531,,213,based on these results i can conclude that plastic be has the most stretchability. these results are valid because of the two trials so i can confidently conclude this to improve the validity even more would be to use the same length plastic for each type because this may affect the results also the should give a specific weight to add on the procedure instead of just saying add weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3532,,213,the conclusion of this experiments that plastic i is the stretches with 22 and comm stretched in the two trials an average of 22.5mm plastic a was the least stretchy with 10 and 12 my stretched in the two trials an average of 11mm. the student could have improved the experiment by performing on trial 3 (t3) for the plastics to ensure validity another way could be to let the weights hang even longer or add more weights to each plastic to ensure validity,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3533,,213,a based on the data table the polymer plastic with the most stretchability is plastic type i because it was stretched out the furthest then the next most stretchy was do then ca then the least was a up be two ways to improve the experimental design or validity of the results are be more specific how much weight is being added to the plastics and for to i believe that a different amount of weight should be added to the plastic types,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3534,,213,in conclusion plastic a is the strongest and plastic i is the weakest up the student could improve the validity of the results by i saying in t1+t2 they used 2 different sets of 4 kinds of plastics and i you can also have at least one other person there to verify this,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0

3597,,213,aii conclude that plastic type i stretched the most because in the trial it stretched comm and in the second 23mm. plastic type a stretched the least because it only stretched comm in the first and comm in the second trial.^p bathe students could have improved their experiment in several ways first off that could have identified a specific amount of weight to add on to the clamp.they could have also included a control,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3598,,213,a one conclusion i observed based on the student's data is that plastic type i is the most stretchable of the 4.^p be two ways the experimental design could have been improved are if i the student described the amount of weight putting the bags and i the student could have done the trials again using more time,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3599,,213,a in conclusion the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic be up be two ways that the student could of improved his or her investigation is by saying how many weights will they student put and how much does it weigh . also describe how long the plastic types were before she started her experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3600,,213,a my conclusion is that the second trial went better than the first because the numbers are much larger than the first up be the first way is the students could have been more specific on what they did and the serena way is they should have said what types of plastics and tapes they was using,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3601,,213,a trial 2 was the one with the most stretchability. trial 1 was around the trial e's numbers but trial 2 was a ting but tiger or stayed the same plastic i actully decreased one up be they should have tryedengce plastic more trials to see it most would increase or decrease,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3602,,213,a in conclusion some of the plastics stretched more than others however all of them did stretch polymer a stretched the least and polymer i stretched the most from the results it can be assumed that all polymers stretch up the student needs to specify how much weight is added and what the starting and ending measurement of each plastic were,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3603,,213,the conclusion of this lab shows that in the first trial the plastic was stretched ammo trial two it was stretched ammo surprisingly in the third trial it actually got smaller by ammo also the last trial it stayed the same length two improvements could have been how the students should have made the weights heavier and should have made a clearer data table,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3604,,213,"the students can conclude plastic type a is least stretchable, and plastic type i is the most stretchable and will be less likely to break the students could have improved the experimental design by telling us what they originally measured the plastic in (ft,cm,in. e.t.c) told us how many weights and how much they weighed and the type of tape that tapped the plastic in the table",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3605,,213,the conclusion based on the student's data is that with trial and with trial 2 there were some changes happen the amount of plastic stretched more the second trial than the first two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is in what minute did the stretch begin and what plastic was the strongest,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3606,,213,"based on the data it can be concluded that plastic a is the least stretchable, and plastic i is the most plastic a stretched comm and comm in both trials which was the smallest length plastic i stretched comm and 23mm, which was the largest length after five minutes the students could have improved their experiment and their results by using plastic samples of the same length and by allowing the plastic to stretch for a longer period of time",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3607,,213,plastic a was obviously the most susceptible to stretching because it stretch 2 inches while plastic i only stretched i plastic i did not stretch at all and plastic i lost an inch this experiment would be more valid if the procedure said how much weight to add to the plastic so that it was known what it takes to stretch it and how the plastic was being measured . although the data table says that the procedure does not,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3608,,213,the conclusion i have drawn is that plastic type i both trials stretched the same amount also that to was better two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results is by comparing their trials to different plastics and collecting that data,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3609,,213,a based on the students data plastic type i had more stretchability than the others up be the student could have done more trials or added on more time for the plastics to stretch longer,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3610,,213,a plastic type i was the most stretchy and stretched the longest during the given time up be the way the students could of improved was they could of conducted more trials to improve the validity of the results also in their procedure they could of said to make sure each polymer plastic was measured out before the experiment so they all start at the same length,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3611,,213,plastic be proven by the results is the most stretchable of the four plastics due to it stretching comm on the first trial and 23 my on the second trial its average amount stretched to 22.5 my making it comm stretcher the the runner up plastic up one way they could have improved the design of the experiment is by making sure all the plastics used had the same initial length also to tell how much the weights of the clamp weighed to be able to conduct the experiment to do more trials,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3612,,213,a the plastic that stretched was i to and the least was a the up be the way the student could of improved this expiremen is by when they put tape on top of the edge of the plastic sample to a table well they should of left putting weight on the plastic to see how much it holds,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3613,,213,a based on the students data i can draw the conclusion that plastic type i had the most stretchability. if you you refer back to the graph in trial i plastic i was 22 and in trial 2 it was 23 which was more than any of the other plastics be one way in which the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding another trial they could also have told you how long the type of plastic was to begin with in the first place therefore increasing the validity and accuracy of the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3614,,213,student will wrap up an conclusion after plastic type & the amount it strech is done the whole experiment was based on how far each plastic stretched and which one stretched the first and also the one which'd stretched the least up they could have improved it by stretching each plastic three separate trial and the answer would have been more clear,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3615,,213,two ways that the students could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results is by increasing the amount of times they stretched the plastic and the plastic type could get changed,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3616,,213,a plastic i seemed to be the most durable because in it stretched comm in to it stretched comm and the least durable seemed to be plastic a because in to only stretched comm and in to it stretched comm be they could have specified the type of plastic and long in seconds was the plastic being stretched,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3617,,213,from the data i am able to conclude that plastic type i is the most durable its length stretched to be 22 and 23.this show that it was able to hold the heaviest amount of weights be one way the student could improve the experimental design is by using same weights for each plastic also the student should use the same measuring just so they can be reassured that the length of the plastic is accurate for each of the 4 plastics,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3618,,213,the conclusion is that the plastic did stretched out but some stayed the same length and other decreased up the student would have improved is by having a control group by doing it by a certain weight and other put more weight see if there any difference in ti stretchability.,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3619,,213,of the four types of plastic a and i stretched about the same amount of weight and i stretched about the same amount the first way they could improve the experiment would be to test different amounts of weight they should also only measure what hangs over the table both times for a more precise results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3620,,213,a to conclude plastic type i is the most stretchable out of all four types of plastics type i stretched 22 my on the and 23 my on to average of 22.5 mme while type a and i ranged between 10 my and 11 mme and type i 20 mme type a was the most stretch resistant so this type of plastic would be the best for grocery bags so that food doesn't fall out up two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much the weights attached to the clamp on the plastic weighed and how long the plastic should be for each type should it be the same or different,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3621,,213,"based upon the given data i can conclude that plastic i had the most stretchability. the first thing the student needs to fix is in his experimental design in step i she says to add weight ..."" but they don't specify how much weight to add the next thing that needs to be fixed deals with validity the student needs to record the starting length of each plastic as well as keep their length constant up say eat amount of weights to add record starting length of plastics",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3622,,213,"abased on the students data plastic i was able to be stretched the most it was stretched 22 my the first time and 23 the second.^p (b)first, the student should have stated how much weight to add to the clamp and measured how much the clamp weighed to get the total weight added would've improved validity also the student should have made the plastic sample all the same length so that they started from the same point",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3623,,213,i predict according to this experiment that the student could improved their experiment by try one more time find out the control find out the variables find out the independent variable & dependent variable do a hypothesis & conclusion that's what i think the student have to do to validity the results of the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3624,,213,a based on the students data one can conclude that plastic type i had the most stretchability. for both trials preformed type i stretched the furthest at 22 my + 23mm. therefore this type of plastic is probably the most durable of the 4 because it was able to withstand such stretching up be the students could have improved by specifying what types of plastics to use instead of just a be i or do also by specifying how far from the edge of the table each piece of plastic needs to be taped as this can effect results if they are not all the same lengths,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3625,,213,3. a base on the data given plastic i stitched for nest up be the student could have written the starting length of the plastic he also cook have put his reasoning for doing the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3626,,213,my conclusion is that plastic type a can stretch the least because not only did it not stretch anymore in to it actually got umm shorter plastic type a is the best because it can stretch the most it stretched umm more in the up be one way the student could have improved higher experimental design andlor validity of the results is to include the data on what the plastics measured before he added weights he could have also included the weights of the weights he added,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3627,,213,atthe amount stretched by to showed more improvement by having it stretched because the different material both were investigated at the same time one place was more affected.^p bone way is is by maybe leaving it a little longer or use different types of weight,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3628,,213,"based on the students data we can conclude that plastic i has the most stretchability compared to plastics act or do in trial 1 plastic type i stretched comm and comm in trial 2. all of the other plastics stretched less than this amount for example plastic a only stretched 10 & comm for trials i 2. ways this experiment can be improved can be do to even more trials order to verify results even greater they also can specify the size of the plastic and keep it constant the length of each plastic shows the same if the plastics are of different sizes then the results could be affected also the students could have also specified how much like weight is and used the same amount of weights for each one if one plastic had 21 keg on it and another 31kg, then the one with ekg may stretch farther not because it has more stretchability but because it was held by more weight this is how they could improve",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3629,,213,a in conclusion the amount strech to stretched a little bit more than to by 2 mme i shows that to can strech more than the up be one way they can improve by waiting a little longer the five minutes and second way is that they should of used three kinds of different plastics,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3630,,213,a from the results of the experiment you can see that plastic type i has the highest amount of stretchability while plastic type a has the lowest amount of stretchability.^p be the students should use the same amount of weights for each plastic and add a control to the experiment to improve the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3631,,213,based on the students data plastic a and i both stretched umm more on the second trial but the plastic type that had stretched the most in trial 1 and 2 is plastic be up the student could of improved this experiment by adding the weights but with a certain amount of weight that was used the same on each plastic and trial also the student should have stretched each sample as far as it would got,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3632,,213,a the data shows that trial two was more efficient than trial one because they all increase other than one plastic type i can also conclude that the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic be up be two ways the students could have improved there experiments are 1. let it hang for longer than five minutes and 2. perform more trials,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3633,,213,a my conclusion on the experiment is that plastic type i has the longest my stretched out be (1) the student have put the plastic on a hanging string was a steamy boiling pot of water (2) then the student could have recorded more valid and improved data on a chart,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3634,,213,by the out come of this experiment you can tell that plastic i is the stretchiest. two things that could have been done to improve the experiment are making sure how long the plastics should be in the beginning and if all the plastic types should be the same length before you tape them,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666

3636,,213,the two ways that the students could have improved on this experimental design is one what kind of plastic where they using and name each one the second would be what would you measure the plastic what type of measuring stick you would use or a triple beem balance also they could have dawn three trials to make there experiment valid,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3637,,213,a based on the results i can conclude that plastic types i and i had a similar stretchability because they increased by ammo type i and i are not as stretchable because type actually decreased by umm after trial 2 and type i stayed the same up be the student should have told us much each weight and how many will go on the plastic types,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3638,,213,a plastic type i can stretch the most while a has the most tensile strength because it stretched the least up be the student could have improved their design by having the plastic be the same length for each plastic for example each could be a foot long a second change would be to put the same amount on each plastic for example each could have a lag weight,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3639,,213,in conclusion after doing this experiment i came to the conclusion that the plastic type by was the one with the longest length of the plastic types it had comm in the first trial and it had comm in the second trial up the student could've waited more than mins to measure the length,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3640,,213,my conclusion would be that plastic type do would be the most stretchy because it went up to comm with out tearing two ways students could have make the experiment by one cutting a determined length for all four plastics and recording the time it took to stretch .,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3641,,213,a a conclusion i can draw from this is that plastic type a had stretched comm the first trial and comm in the second trial making it the most stretchable plastic type up be i think that this student should have done at least 3 trials i think this student should have not taped the plastic at the top of the table he should have done it over a bar so both sides could be tested,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3642,,213,a the plastic thas has the most stretchability is plastic type i a stretch of comm in the first trial and in the comm in the second trial plastic type a has the worst stretchability. stretching comm in the first trial and comm in the second trial up be they should have stated and used the same amount of weights for each trial they also should have used the same amount of each plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3643,,213,a based on the student's data the amount of stretchability in each spastic type was different for trial 1 and 2. with an exception of type i that remained the same up be two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to clarify the weight of the weight they added on step i then for step 6 they should have had clarified the procedure that had to be repeated sex repeat steps 1-5 exactly for other three plastic plastic samples,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3644,,213,aii see that the amount stretched of plastic a & i increased on the second trial but the amount stretched of plastic a decreased and the amount stretched for plastic i remained the same up be the student could have make a third trial to see what the outcome would be the student could have made the trials for another period of time so instead of five ins and he does ten minutes for each of them,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3645,,213,a based on the students trials i have come to conclusion that plastic i was able to stretch more than a ca i witch make it more resistant then the rest.^p bathe students could of group this experiment on each experiment to see how much it could change and they could of also made a graph to show the results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3646,,213,"a to conclude the polymer plastics went through four trials the data shows that a was averaged to 11, i was averaged to 22.5, i was averaged to 13.5, and i stayed at 20. the plastic type i stretched to most i predict that if they did a hard trial the numbers would be close up be the students could of improved if they let the plastic hang for 10 minutes and maybe the results wouldn't be so close also add more details to the procedure",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333

3649,,213,based on the data i was the most stretchable polymer followed by doc and lastly a serious sources of error need fixing for one the initial length of plastic was not held constant making all data most also allowing the plastics to stretch until breaking would truly test this property however as the results are consistent between trials the results seem valid,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3650,,213,a based on the students data plastic type i stretched the most all of the bags stretched only around 1 to umm difference in both trials compared to their first up be two ways the student could have improved the experimental design andlor validity of the results was to show the length before they were stretched and show the amount of weight added onto the clamps,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3651,,213,the plastic that stretched the most in both trials was plastic type be it stretched-22mm and the second trial it stretched 23 mme that shows it has the most durability for stretching up the students should have put down the measurement they chose to start the plastic at they should have also included the time on the data table they should have done various trials to the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3652,,213,they could take notes and make a bar graph and put all of it together and come out with the answer up they could use a weight and find out how much the weight by its self,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3653,,213,by the process or doing it the graph showed me that the amount of stretched of to and to didn't change both plastic had the same stretched and it would change by adding more weights because the plastic wouldn't be reliable as the other one,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3654,,213,a according to my conclusion i was the one who got stretch the longest and a was the shorter one be one way they could do this to make it better is by using different plastics type or by duck taping the plastic to a cup and start putting weighs until it breaks,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3655,,213,for plastic type a the amount stretched increased by one mme for plastic type do the amount stretched for trial one and two were the same with plastic ca the results decreased by one mme the students could improve their results by repeating more trials they also didn't mention the measure the plastic be originally,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3656,,213,the conclusion is most student plastic stretched more then others they could improved the experiment by leave the clips 30 mins,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3657,,213,a plastic type i stretch the most than i then i then a the second trial all of the plastic began to stretch even more beside plastic ca plastic i didn't increase it's stretching in trial to actually in trial 1 it stretched more than in trial 2.,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666

3659,,213,a i would conclude that plastic a is the strangest because it didn't stretch as much as plastics be i or do up be one thing the student's could have done to improve their experiment is include exactly how much weight they put on each clamp so it could easy repeated and easier to understand another thing they can do is do a third trial for more accurate results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3660,,213,a plastic i is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types up be the validity should be improved if the students specified how much weight was added to the clamp also specified how high up the table was,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3661,,213,plastic i happens to stretch the forthis in trial 1 & 2. the student could have used more plastic also the students could have used more trials that would have shown the accuracy,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3662,,213,a in conclusion the student's data that was recorded showed plastic type i capable of stretching the most than do than ca & plastic type a stretched the least up be one way the students could have improved the experiment design/validity of the results would be by learning a hypothesis another thing that could be an improvement is if they varied the times the plastic hanged for up the amount of weight for each type,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3663,,213,"a based on the student data plastic i is the most stretchable. plastic i stretched an average of 22.5mm, while the next most stretched plastic was do with an average of 20mm. up be to improve validity/design, the student could have conducted more trials the students also should have specified exactly how heavy the weights used are so that the experiment is recreatable.",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3664,,213,a the more weight used the more the plastic stretched up be they should've used something more strong than tape to hang the plastic from the table and specify if all the plastic pieces are the same length and wid therefore they start experimenting on them they should also say how much weight they are adding on at a time and how log you wait before adding on more weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3665,,213,by the result of the student's investigation they have concluded that plastic type i is the stretches polymer of all four and plastic type a is the least stretches polymer up three ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by starting off with each polymer with the same length the same amount of weights for each polymer and repeating the experiment 3 times instead of 2.,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0

3670,,213,to conclude the polymer investigation according to data plastic a is the stretchiest. plastic i is the least stretchy up two ways the student could have improved this experiment is by 1. telling us how long the plastic measured before it was stretched another way is by 2. how much did the weights weight,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3671,,213,based on the students data it shows that plastic type a had the highest stretch constance to the weights pulling on it in the two trials it only stretched 10 and comm while the next best stretched 13 and 14. one way to improve their experiment is to have performed a third trial although their test two were similar to end results the third trial would only have made it more valid definitely proving their results are correct another way is to specify how heavy the weights are and what type of plastic is being used then the reader would know exactly what you've doing in the experiment and it'd give a better understanding,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3672,,213,a a conclusion drawn from this experiment would be that plastic type i has the most flexibility be one way to improve the experiment would be to make sure each plastic gets weights in the same places another step would be to make sure the clamp was on the same place on each plastic so the experiment is more valid,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3673,,213,based on the students data plastic type i in trials 1 and 2 stretched the most and have the most stretchability. up one way the student could improve this is by using the same weight for each bag and trial another way is by using the same clamp type so it's the same weight added from it each time,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3674,,213,a conclusion that can be reached based on the student's data would be that the best plastic type to use to prevent breakage of a bag would be type do it was not stretched at all when the weights were added one way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to conduct more trials and the average not the results this would ensure which plastic is the strongest another way to improve validity would be to specify the weight used and know it as a control for each plastic type these two things must be done to ensure validity,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3675,,213,based on the data i can conclude that the plastics stretched more in the second trial compared to the first trial also i can conclude that plastic i stretched the most because it held the most weight one way the students can improve the experimental design is to include exactly what plastic they are using another way the could improve their experimental design is to include what they are using as weights reach plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666

3717,,213,a plastic type i is easily the most sufficient plastic because it had the highest measurements for both trials up be they could of easily measured for more time this way they could see how much more it could stretch 2. they could of had one more trial usually an experiment has 3 trials this way average will be more precise,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3718,,213,based on the student's data we can conclude that plastic type i had the most stretchability. the student could have improved the experimental design andlor validity of the results by doing more trials so there can be an average of the amount stretched instead of having 2 measurements that are both different and by stating how much the weight should weigh because different weight size could cause the plastic to stretch more or less,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3719,,213,a the students plastic seemed to get longer with each trial except for plastic type i and i which decreased and stayed the same up be the student could have performed another trial they also can use different kinds of plastic for the next experiment to improve it and show us the begging length for trial 1 to see how much it stretched,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3720,,213,army conclusion is that plastic i stretched more than the other types of plastic because plastic a stretched up to the average 11 and plastic i had an average of 22.5.^p (b)two ways the student could have improved the experimental are (1)the student could do more trials and (2)the student could gave the information about the measure of each sample of plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3721,,213,a based on the data shown the polymer plastics will stretch but not much plastic type a stretched out the most out of the four.^p be one way the students could have improve is by doing more trials another way it could be improved is by stating how much the weights weigh & how many are being put onto the plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3722,,213,a the conclusion could be that plastic i was the strongest of the plastics because it did not stretch at all up be two ways this experiment could have been improved is by telling how much wright to add to the clamp and the detentions of plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3723,,213,a plastic type i had the most stretchability while plastic type a had the least.^p be all the plastics should be the same length make a machine add the weights and remove them and the clamp bac a human may place the weight wa different amount of force for every plastic put two clamps instead of tape bac the tape may evert it's own force while the clamps wont,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3724,,213,a in conclusion plastic type i was the most stretchable polymer plastic.^p be the student could tell you the size of the polymer plastic and make sure all of them are the same size also the student can tell you how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3725,,213,a since there were four different types of plastics type i seemed to stretch the longest both trails because it is most likely the strongest.^p be perform even more trials for validity and be are to keep the clamp the weights and wherever you hang the plastic constant for each trial you could also perform a control experiment with no weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3726,,213,a in trial two the plastics stretched more expect for plastic ca up be the students could have done another trial they could be specific with how much the weights weight the students could have named the typed of plastic they used instead of using abc and do,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3727,,213,i could concluded that plastic type i was stretched the most after the experiment which would instate that it is the most flexible on the other hand plastic type a stretched the least meaning it is the least flexible cut of the 4 plastic types to improve this experiment the experiment could have had more trials accurate data the weight could have been increase and or the trials for better results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3728,,213,a in conclusion polymer be is the one that could stretch the most and polymer a is the one who can't stretch as wide up be to make the validity of the experiment more accurate than they should of had exact measurements for example in step i the could of said how much it should be hanging by also the could of added another trial it is always good to have 3 trials just in case of any mistakes,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3729,,213,a a conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic i is the strongest out of all the plastic at 22mm. in the first trial had comm in the second trial because it stretch more than all the other up be two the student could have improved the experimenting and / or validity of the result are to add new types of plastics and add more trials to the containers,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3730,,213,out of the four different polymer plastics for stretchability the most stretched was plastic type be the least amount stretched was plastic a two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results would have tried different time lengths maybe like 10 minutes after 5 minutes repeat the experiment all together with all types of plastics,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3731,,213,a according to the students data 2/4 of the plastics stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial by the minimum of 1mm.^p be two ways the student could have improved their experimental design is 1. they should have taken more trials at least two more and 2. they should used more types of plastics,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3732,,213,based on the data a conclusion would be that the plastic types pretty much were the same as each trial give or data a my each trial up this ways the students could have improved the experiment is explain how much the weight weighed and did that weight stay the same for every types of plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3733,,213,"in conclusion based on the data from the chart each trial for plastics a be ca and i were increasing decreasing or staying the same the most stretchable would be plastic i . it started off as the stretchiest, before it was pulled and remained that way afterwords. up be the student could have said what types of plastic was used and not just a be i or do he also could have done more than 2 trials 3 would have been better",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3734,,213,in conclusion plastic type i was the strongest plastic in trial 1 it stretched to 22 my while plastic i only stretched to comm and i to 14mm. in trial 2 plastic i stretched to comm while i only stretched to comm and i to 13mm. one way the student could have improved their experimental design was to stretch the plastic until it was about to brake to get the full stretchability. the student could have also done more trials to get more valid results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3735,,213,my conclusion would be that plastic type i stretched the most but not the same amount the and trial it stretched 1 my more than the est trial and plastic type a stretched the least the 10 my and t2:12mm but it stretched 2 my more in the and trial than the first up two ways they could have improved the experimental design and for identify of results is they could have made another trial (t3) at least and could have let the weight hang longer than 3 minutes,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3736,,213,a and i did not stretch too far but i and i stretched much more the student could have given the beginning lengths in his data or he could have added more and more weights and seen how far the plastics would stretch,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3737,,213,"a the most plastic type i had the most stretchability in the trial , it stretched comm visible plastic type a stretched comm and in trial 2 it stretched comm while type a stretched 12mm. up be the students should had the lengths of the plastics start out he same that way no plastic could be able to hold more weights since it was longer students should also specify how many weights are added for five minutes so that way a plastic doesn't stretch more just because it had more weights",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3738,,213,according to the data table plastic type a was the most strechable. type i and i decreased when measured again after having placed weights and type i stayed the same therefore type a was the most strechable considering the longitude it made by ammo,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3739,,213,based on our results of the polymer investigation we found out that plastic type a stretched the most of two mme type i stretched the second furthest at ammo and type i lost 1 my and finally type i didn't lose or gain any length two ways the student could have improved the validity was to make sure he used the same amount of weight at the end of the plastic and that the plastic was taped at the same spot at the top of the table,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3740,,213,i can conclude that plastic type i was superior and has more stretch ability than any other plastic type up be the student could have added more trials to secure the validity that plastic type i had the most stretchability. the student could have drastically improved the experimental design by mentioning how much the weights weight,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3741,,213,based on the students data plastics type i stretched the most in both trials two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is one way they could of have one more trials and see the results another thing they could have done was try to stretch the plastic over a different type of texture,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3742,,213,a as shown by the data plastic i was the plastic that stretched the most all the other plastics were between - 20 while plastic i needed the with comm and 23mm. be a control always improves the validity of date so one would help the experiment more trials could also help so we are no outliers or mistakes,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3743,,213,wait appears that sample a was the strongest after trial 1 it was comm and after trial 2 it was 12mm. samples i and i were the weakest sample i after trial 1 was comm and sample i was comm and after trial 2 sample i was comm and sample was 20mm.^p bone way the student could have improved the experiment is by specifically saying what plastic he was testing . another way is by saying how much the weights weighed,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3744,,213,a based on the procedure the results were not valid how much weight am i supposed to add up be the validity could have been improved by telling me how much weight to add or what kind of weights to used,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3745,,213,from the student i can draw the conclusion that plastic types i has the least amount of stretchability ( it did not stretch at all i the student had a very thorough procedure but they could have improved it they could have added more weights to the plastics to see how much weight it could have taken to stretches well as done more than two trials for each of the different plastics,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3746,,213,a from the data i am draw the conclusion that polymer i had the most stretchability. polymer plastic i stretch an average of 22.5mm which was greater than polymer a i and do up be to improve this experiment the students should make sure that the amount of weight put on each plastic sample to make sure that the type of plastic was the only variable involved also the students should run more trials to make sure that their results were valid with more trials the experiment will get more results and a better chance that they are accurate,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0

3748,,213,a plastic type i is the stretches of all the plastics tested plastic a is the strongest and stretch the least amount up be the student should have desire that the plastic sheets started out the same length also must have had the same amount of weights applied,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3749,,213,"a according to the student's data plastic type i is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types up be first the students could have used a specific length for each plastic strip to begin with because they will most likely stretch more if they are longer to begin with second they should make sure that they add the same weight for each trial and plastic because they are measuring chevibility, not how much weight each can hold",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3750,,213,each type of plastic stretched about the same or a couple millimeters off to its counterpart in the second trial the students could have improved the design by getting and telling specific types of plastic to use and to tell us what unit of measurement to measure the stretched and then stretched plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3751,,213,a conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type i was the most stretchable of the plastics the student could improve their experimental design would be to make sure all the different plastics were the same length before the weights were added and make sure to include that original measurement in the data table the student should also keep the number of weights on the plastic constant because if are plastic had more weight applied to it then another it may appear to have stretched more,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0

3753,,213,a based on the data it can be concluded that plastic types i has the least strength or the most elasticity because it stretched the farthest of all the other plastics plastic i is the second and plastic i is the third plastic with least strength or most elasticity since plastic a had the least stretched length it is the strongest or least plastic plastic up be to improve the validity of this experiment it would be wise to sure that each plastic is not only the same size but is also taped at the exact same spot to the table and is clamped at the same spot as well this will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors it is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used the same amount of weight should be used for each plastic trial to ensure that weight is not a variable in the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3754,,213,the plastic type i had stretched the most to improve this lab they could of did more trials to see if their results were correct and give us what each type of plastic is and write a hypothesis based on the start of the lab to know the task at hands,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3755,,213,based on the data table both trails were basically the same but they could have improve the experiment by using different weights so they could see the difference also the shouldn't have add a clamp to the and of the plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3756,,213,plastic type i has 19 better chance of having stretchability because during both trials the amount stretched out equal so it has a accurate chance of stretching the student could have improved this experimental design by adding another trial and repeating the same procedure,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3757,,213,due to the data i can tell that type i stretches the and most but was consistent through both trials i can also see that type a stretched the least amount type i thought stretches the most from the data i know that type i plastic is the best because it can strech the most without breaking this means that the chemical bonds in the polymers are mostly covalent bonds the student could have improved their experiment by saying how much weight they added as well as be more specific in the procedure about the plastic types,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666

3919,,213,i conclude from this lab that plastic type be stretched the most out of all of the polymers this means it has more elasticity than the others i also conclude that plastic type a stretched the least out of all of the polymers this means it has less elasticity than the other types of polymers up one way the student could improve the lab is to add more trials that would make the hypothesis more true another way is by deleting human mistake by meaning correctly and things like that,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3920,,213,a after testing and collecting data i compared each result and i it either stretched by 2 to 1 my each test sometimes it don't move.^p a by doing more trials and by having the same amount of weight in each one,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3921,,213,"a based on the students data i can conclude that plastic i has the most stretchability. the data shows that in both trials to and t2), plastic i stretched 22 and 23. up be the students could have done another trial to make their data more valid they also could have let the weights hang more than five minutes",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3922,,213,the results from the students polymer lab show that plastic type i stretched furthest in both that's then any other material the students could have improved the experiment by telling how much weight to add to each same and by telling how to specifically add them if shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp as always more trials will increase the validity of any results in a science lab,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3923,,213,a good conclusion i can make from the data is type a and i were the most alike and types i and i were the most alike for example for to type a had 10 and type i had 14 and for to type i had 22 and type i had 20. the student could have improved the experimental design by telling the reader how much plastic should be hanging down the table and also he should have been told how heavy the weights were,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3924,,213,based on the student's data the conclusion i have drawn up is that plastic i was the most stretchy in both trial 1 and trial 2. plastic i stretched the most out of all the plastics two ways this student could have improved the experimental design was to have a constant and to add that there are four different types of plastics not just one,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3925,,213,a the conclusion would be that plastic i had the most stretchability while plastic a had the least up be two ways they could improve their experiment would be to add more trials truly good experiment has at least 3 trials another would be to make the procedure more understandable and they should keep the weights on for longer this will give more extensive and accurate data,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3926,,213,based on the data that has been recorded it lists that the second trial that they did with the bags was the trial where the bags were able to hold on to the weights and stretch out the most a way that the students could of have improved their experiment would've been to add more weights and see at how much they would of ripped instead of waiting 5 minutes,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3927,,213,a i came to the conclusion that plastic type i had the most stretchability out of all plastics plastic i was stretched to an average of 33. up be the student could have improved his experimental design by conducting a third trial and telling the readers what plastics were involved in the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666

3929,,213,all of the plastics stretched plastic a stretched the least plastic i stretched the most.^p 2 ways the student could of improved the experimental design is by doing a ord trial and also saying how much weight was added,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3930,,213,the second trial 2 of the plastic stretched a little more one actually decreased a mme the student should've done it a better way instead of taping it to side of the table also they could've have much weight they were adding to the clamp,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3931,,213,based on the data documented in the table i can conclude that over that plastic type i has the most elasticity because on both trials it stretched to 20mm.two ways that the student could have improved the design or validity could have been to specify the amount of the weights being used and specify on what types of plastic to use.this would make the validity higher,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3932,,213,based on the data table each trail for each type of plastic was fairly similar also from the table it is clear to see that plastic is was the most flexible as it stretched comm in the first trial and comm in the second trial plastic a was the least flexible.the first trial stretched comm in length and in the second trial 12mm.therefore out of all the plastics plastic i had the greatest stretchability. however one way the results could have been improved is by measuring the length ammo of the plastic when they break or even after a longer period of time.this will show the true stretchability of each plastic another improvement could be naming types of plastic that were being future trial can be done and the best plastic could be put to good used,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3933,,213,"a plastic a was comm long & then it reached out to comm plastic i was comm & then went to 23mm, plastic i was comm & then went to comm & plastic i was comm & than stayed the same be one way this student could have improved was to give us the types of plastic besides sayin take one sample of a plastic another way was to give examples & give more details i say the validity is not right because if i want my store this experiment excatly from word to word then i would have gotten something different",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3934,,213,the conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type i did the best out of all of the other plastic types in both trial 1 and 2. also two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of the experiment again and to use more plastic types,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3935,,213,in conclusion our hypothesis was hiding because plastic type i stretched the most instead of plastic type ca up two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the results are they could have included how much weight they put on the clamps and also they could have left the weights on far more than 5 minutes,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3936,,213,based on the students data the plastic type i was the plastic with the most stretchability. the group could have improved their design by specifying how much weight weighed and kept it constant by having each weight the same also they should have included before and after length in their design table,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3937,,213,a plastic i has most cross-linking because it is the strongest and stretched furthest up be the student should have increments in which the weights are added and how much of the plastic should be hanging off the side each plastic should be the same length,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3938,,213,a based on the data shown in the table one strongest type of was plastic be but plastic i had a constant amount of stretch up be one way the student could have improved the experimental design was by including how much weight to add also to compare the results with any other student who performed his same experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333

3942,,213,a my conclusion is that the experiment was very un organized and not well thought - out up these student could have improved their experimental design by one telling us the materials they used like what kind of plastic objects they used like whether or not they were strechable. just to give us more of a second thought about how there data came out they could have organized their data lot better,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3943,,213,i conclude that after seeing the data that plastic type i is the most stretchable out of all the plastics i say this because in trial i it stretched comm and trial 2 it stretched 23mm. the plastic that stretched the closest to that was type do which stretched to comm both times two ways that they could have improved in labs validity is one adding a third trial to each plastics and two taking the same of the trials and finding in weight stretch for each type,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3944,,213,a plastic type i stretched the farthest in both trials while plastic type a stretched the least meaning type i was more stretchability than type a up be one way the student could've improved this experiment would be to add a control group so you could see the initial lengths of the plastics another way would be to to add more trials to average out the stretchability.,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3945,,213,a plastic type a is stronger than the rest up be there a set length and width for each piece of plastic instead of it being whatever it happens to be a different size may mean a difference in durability and strength,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666

3959,,213,a plastic type a stretched the most (2mm) and type i did not.stretch at all up be all plastics started at the same length make sure the temperature is the same,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3960,,213,polymer type i was the strongest plastic with only a difference or umm in two trials this student could've listed the starting length of the plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3961,,213,"according to the student's data plastic i stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. plastic i was the second most flexible because it stretched an average of 20mm, while plastic i was the third most flexible plastic because it stretched an average of 13.5mm. lastly plastic a stretched the least with an average of 11mm. however these results are not valid in order to make them valid the students would need to use plastics that are the same length and use the same weight to stretch this would ensure valid results because it would be guaranteed the same size plastic was being pulled with the same forces",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3962,,213,a my conclusion would be that plastic i stretched the most because it had the farthest lengths both times up be they should have put weights to make the weight even on the other side they should've also done more trials on the other types of wrap,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3963,,213,3. a plastic type i stretched out the most between the two trials with plastic type i coming on close up be the students could've made a third trial to be more valid & or allow the weights to hang more than 5 min instead it could've been 10 mind,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3964,,213,a according to this investigation the shorter the plastic is the more it will stretch up the experiment is not very valid due to the following we are not aware of what each plastic type is also more trials should have been done so you could have more of a comparison between each trial two trials is not enough,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3965,,213,two ways could have been improved is by doing group and they needed a hypothesis to know wether their question was right or wrong i conclusion is the plastic type a and i there used because they might have putter more weights on different types for the second trial,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
3966,,213,a conclusion about this students data is plastic type i stretched the most two ways the student could have improved the design or validity of results is they should have said if the weights had to be the same mass they could have also told the type of tape to use because some tapes hold up more heavier things than other types do,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3967,,213,"3. a plastic a and i have very similar inatups based on the amount they stretched and likewise with plastic i and do up be the entire procedure is vague and contains no actual numbers one way they could have improved would be if they specified the amount of weight they used to get this results they got and the way , just to help the people trying to perform this experiment this experiment would would be to specify which plastics are done at which time",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3968,,213,in conclusion to plastic that had the most stretchability was plastic a it is the most flexible because the changed the most from trial to trial 2. it changed by ammo the student could have improved on there experiment by adding more trials to increase validity and compare the plastic from before the weights were put on we don't know the length of the plastic at first or how much weight they used,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3969,,213,a plastic bad on the second trial had the most stretch than the other plastic act up be by doing it 3 times instead of 2.(trial) and showing the difference for example i on the the second trial stretched more than i by 3.,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3970,,213,a a conclusion that i can draw from the students data is that plastic type i stretched the most and plastic type a stretched the least up be two ways the students could have improved their experimental design is one they should have stated what four types of plastic they were using secondly they should have said the amount of weights they put on the clamp,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666

3973,,213,according to the results shown on the table i can conclude that the plastic type i is the most stretchable. type i stretched the most at 23 mme type i stretched comm while type i stretched 14mm. type a only stretched 12 mme there are many ways that the group could have improved their design one thing the could have shown is the initial length of the plastic also the group could have shown how much weight they added to the clamps this would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3974,,213,a plastic i was definitely the most stretchy and of all the plastics up be he could have recorded how much the plastic stretched at certain intervals of time maybe every minutes he also could have tested both plastics each to back the same way twice in 3 trials,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3975,,213,a plastic type i had the most stretchability. up to improve the validity of the results the students could have measured the plastic 2 times on each trial,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
3976,,213,as the type of plastic changed from type a all the way to type do the amount of stretch increased from comm to 23mm. up they could increase the amount of trials and make all plastics starting length the same,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3977,,213,a in conclusion plastic type i was stretched the farthest for both trials and plastic type a had the least amount of stretching up be the students could have improved their experiment's by adding more trials and tell us the specific amount of weight used for each plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
3978,,213,based on the students data plastic type i has the most sretchability. to validate the results the students could have done a third trial and averaged the three lengths for each plastic they could have also specified how much weight was added and keep that consistane.,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
3979,,213,two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design andlor validity of the results the first would be to figure out what kind of plastic and then write it down on the date table the second way would be to write down the average of the to and the a conclusion based on the student's data is which plastic stretched the most,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0

3999,,213,a in conclusion plastic type i is a better polymer plastic for stretchability: due to the fact that the first trial is stretched comm and the second trial it stretched 23mm. the polymer plastic that stretched the least was plastic type a the first trial is stretched comm and the second trail it stretched 12mm.^p be one way they could have improved this experimental design would be by adding a certain amount of weight and another way they could improve it and prove its valid would be with a control,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
4000,,213,based on the student results i can conclude that plastic type i is the most stretchable. in the data plastic type i stretched to 22 my on the and comm in the none of the other plastics had stretched as much then ways to improve this experiment is to add another trial and average the data also the student needed to tell exactly how much weight he clamped to the plastics,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
4001,,213,a a conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that plastic type i has the most stretchability. be 2 ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much weight to put on the clamps and the types of plastics used,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
4002,,213,"a plastic type a stretches longer than all other types in other words it has more stretchability. types bac have the same stretchability, and i has the least stretchability, had the least durability keeping it's structure while the others did not up b)1) made all the types start out in the same length i specified the amount of weight that was applied i recorded the length of the sample before stretching it",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
4003,,213,based on the students data some of the plastic stretched some stayed the same and one of them even got smaller one way they could have improved there experiment is have the plastic all the same size another way they could improve this is by saying how much weight they put on and keep the weight the same for all,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
4004,,213,"a based on the student's data plastic type a is the least stretchable, while plastic type i is the most stretchable. plastic types i and i fall in the middle of these two in terms of stretchability; i was more stretchable than ca up be one way the student could have improved the experiment would be cutting all of the samples to uniform lengths and widths rather than simply measuring what their length already was the student also could have specified how much weight was being added to each sample",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
4005,,213,a plastic type i seems to be more accurate of stretchability because after both trials to and to the amount stretched is the same at 20 mme up be one the experiment could be proved is to repeat the experiment a second way is to make an hypothesis before starting the experiment,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
4006,,213,axis not much of difference of to to to is only 1 or 2 my so is really acuret. be they shouted have more plastic type and more trials,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333

4040,,213,"a based on the students data i can conclude that plastic type a stretched the least it is the strongest of the four because it only stretched an average of comm averaged from the two trials while bus average stretch was 22.5mm cos average stretch was 13.5, and cos average was 20mm. (b). they should have specified the amount of weight they should have specified the size and shape of the plastic",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
4041,,213,a plastic type i stretched the most with 22-23 mme and plastic type a stretched the least with 10-12 mme up be two ways they could have improved the experimental design is by having all of the plastics being the same length in the beginning and adding a certain amount of weights not just saying add weights''.,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0

4043,,213,a i can conclude that this experiment was not valid this student only had two trials instead of three up be this protect could have been valid if the student had three trials and if they had kept their controlled group constant,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
4044,,213,a plastic type i stretched the most because it stretched an average of 22.5 mme plastic type a stretched the least because it stretched an average of 11mm. plastic type i and i are in the middle up be add weights to the clamp before they put it on the plastic specify exactly where the clamp should be placed on the plastic,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
4045,,213,a a conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type a produced the most amount of stretching from trial 1 to trial 2 (10mm to 12mm) compared to all the other plastic types however plastic type i remain the same and on one of the plastic types ca the amount it stretched decrease from 14 to 13. up be two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the result are instead of using one type of plastic they should have used various types to broad the results also the student could have done more trials,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
4046,,213,a based on the students data i conclude that plastic type a was the least stretched out and that plastic type i was the most up be two ways the students could have improved the experimental design andlor validity of the results is by one keeping the amount of weight added to each type of plastic constant and two making sure that the weight of the clamp was subtracted,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
4047,,213,plastic type a was the only type of plastic that stretched the most the student could of improved the experiment design by having two measuring devices also they could of used heavier weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0

4049,,213,a . a conclusion based on the students data is that the stronger the plastic that they use is the harder it is to stretch . for example sample a and i must be thicker because it stretched less up be two ways the students could have improved the experiment was by actually putting the same amount of weight on each and by saying the names,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
4050,,213,polymer i is the most stretchable plastic up the improve the experiment the student could have massed the weight used in step 4 to use the same amount of weight to the plastics in the second trial than the first trial,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
4051,,213,based on the students data results plastic type i stretched the most plastic type a stretched the least two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are that they should of measured how long each piece of plastic was before they added the weights so they can know how much the plastic stretched also they should of used the same amount of weights,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
4052,,213,a according to my results plastic type i had the greatest amount stretched with comm in trial one and in trial 2 with 23mm. i would rely on plastic type i to hold my things up be just way the student's could have made there results validity better one instead of putting plastic type a i i i they should have labeled them by what plastic they were and the students should have seen how far the plastic could stretch before breaking,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
4053,,213,a in conclusion plastic type i had stretched the most in both trial one and trial two plastic type a had stretched the least amount in both trials up be the students could have added how many weights they put on the plastic and how much each weight weighed they should have added how long the plastic was before it was stretched,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
4054,,213,conclusively plastic type i tested to stretch the longest length compared to the other three samples up 1. there is no control in the starting length of the plastics different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results up 2. the amount of weight attached to the clump should be held constant plastic type be which stretched the longest could have had more weight on it than the others,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
4055,,213,a conclusion on could draw is that plastic type i has the most stretchability. a student could improve the design and results by adding more trials and specifying how much weight should be added these two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of the results as well as improve the design,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
4056,,213,a based on the data plastic arc shows a decrease of 1 or 2 ammo of stretch plastic ''d'' is a reasonable plastic to be used as stretchability. up there's no need for improvement for the experiment design or results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
4057,,213,based on the students data plastic type a and i in trial 2 did better than trial i but ca i of trial did better than trial 2. one way the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to measure how can the table was that the weigh were hanging off the plastic with another way the could've done better was to test the trial again to see more results,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
4058,,213,be we need material they are plastic tape clamp it shows that it was the lab of polymer plastics.^p hypothesis if we attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample then weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes and remove the weight measure the length of the plastic because repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastics,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,0,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.0
4059,,213,plastic type i was the most stretchable. it stretched on average 22.5 my while the others did not stretch past 20 mme the student could have improved the experiment as design by including the averages and using 3 trials instead of one also if one made all the plastics the same length one could accurately determine which was the most stretchable.,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666
4060,,213,"a after testing this experiment the results show that plastic sample i stretched the most (mm), making it the weakest plastic plastic type a appeared to have stretched the least amount of mme making it the strongest plastic be the students could have made this experiment more valid by adding a controlled group they could have also done a trial in order to increase the validity of their experiment",based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,1,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.3333333333333333
4061,,213,a we can conclude that plastic i is the most stretchable from all the types but the lab is not valid because judging by the results the lab was not done the same for each trial.^p be two way to improve this lab are have i or third trials at least state the weight of the product used to put on the plastic material,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,3,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
4062,,213,a one conclusion i have fro this data was that plastic do was the weakest and stretched the most up be one way they could have improved this experiment is to make sure all sample sizes are the same length and making a change if they arent another way is by specifying how much weight to add to the clamp at the bottom of the ample,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic i stretched the most plastic i stretched the same amount of 20 my during trial 1 and trial 2. to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results,2,3.0,science,ASAP_sas,0.6666666666666666

26695,,221,white i i would choose to paint the dog house white the reason that i would paint the dog house white is because the inside o i the dog house would then be cooler rather than if you were painting it black the average air temperature when using white after 10 minutes was 42(deg)c rather then when using black after 10 minutes it was 53(deg)c . this has an overwhelming difference of 11(deg)c after just 10 minutes,white i the best paint color for the doghouse would be white inside of the doghouse the air will be cooler for the dog than if it were painted black or gray the average temperature for the black lid was 53(deg) ca but for the white lid it was 42(deg)c. the white lid made the air 11(deg) cooler than the black lid,2,2.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0
26696,,221,black i this color black will help the dog house stay/become warmer since the dog house is outside and for the most part its pretty cold outside the dog house should be black so that the dog who lives in the dog house can stay warm black will do this the most because it absorbs energy better after the 10 minutes in the experiment black was the darkest color and had an average temperature of 53 degrees celsius after the 10 minutes in the experiment white was the lightest color and had an average temperature of 42 degrees celsius so this proves that the darker the color the more energy it will absorb making the object warmer,white i the best paint color for the doghouse would be white inside of the doghouse the air will be cooler for the dog than if it were painted black or gray the average temperature for the black lid was 53(deg) ca but for the white lid it was 42(deg)c. the white lid made the air 11(deg) cooler than the black lid,2,2.0,science,ASAP_sas,1.0

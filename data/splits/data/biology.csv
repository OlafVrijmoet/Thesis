The nucleus has many extra nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil) floating around in the nucleic cytoplasm.  It uses adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) to make mRNA.  First, the DNA unravels to the section needed to make the specific protein.  Then, the tRNA reads the DNA, creating the mRNA by matching up the A, C, G, and T(thymine) on the DNA, with the U, G, C, and A on the mRNA, respectively.The second step, the creation of the protein, takes place in the cytoplasm, on a ribosome.  The rRNA in the ribosome reads the mRNA to decide what amino acids to use.  The mRNA consists of codons, sets of three nitrogenous bases, which correspond to a specific amino acid.  The ribosome creates a long amino acid chain, known as a polypeptide chain.The third step, the polishing of the protein, takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  After the polypeptide chain floats over to the ER, the ER puts the finishing touches on the chain.The fourth step, the packaging of the protein, takes place in the Golgi apparatus.

While in translation it has multiple enzymes with the amino acid linked to the anitcodon and are connected to the other proteins with peptides. Forming the peptyde chain of protiens. This is protein synthesis.","First, the mRNA attaches to a ribosome and then the ribosome reads the mRNA in segments of three, called codons. For each codon, there is a complementary amino acid. Secondly, tRNA picks up the needed amino acids and brings them to the ribosome. Thirdy, the amino acids attach to each other and form a chain of amino acids according to the way in which the codons are read on the mRNA strand by the ribosome. The chain continues to form until the ribosome reaches the stop codon on the mRNA strand. Lastly, the ribosome disconnects from the mRNA strand and the protein is relased to perform its job in the cell.",0.5,3.0,biology,ASAP_sas

Diffusion occurs when there is a high concentration of materials out side of the cell, and a low concentration of the materials inside the cell.

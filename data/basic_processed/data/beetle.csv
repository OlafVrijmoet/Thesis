6587,Explain your reasoning.,130,a and i are on the same closed path with the battery,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6588,Explain your reasoning.,130,removing a bulb will turn off another bulb,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6589,Explain your reasoning.,130,bulbs are on the same closed path,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6590,Explain your reasoning.,130,they are located on the same path and will affect each other,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6591,Explain your reasoning.,130,bulbs a and i are located on the same path,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6592,Explain your reasoning.,130,they are on the same path,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6593,Explain your reasoning.,130,they are the begging and end of the path,a and i are in the same closed path,0,1,,beetle,0.0
6594,Explain your reasoning.,130,they can affect each other,a and i are in the same closed path,0,1,,beetle,0.0
6595,Explain your reasoning.,130,because they are connected along the same path,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6596,Explain your reasoning.,130,each bulb affects the other bulbs,a and i are in the same closed path,0,1,,beetle,0.0
6597,Explain your reasoning.,130,they are on the same path to the battery without interruption,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6598,Explain your reasoning.,130,because there is only one path,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6599,Explain your reasoning.,130,if any of the 3 bulbs are damaged the other 2 bulbs would turn off because they are all within the same path,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6600,Explain your reasoning.,130,bulb a and bulb i are in the same path,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6601,Explain your reasoning.,130,they are on the same path,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6602,Explain your reasoning.,130,wired in same path,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6603,Explain your reasoning.,130,they are all affected by one another along the same path,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6604,Explain your reasoning.,130,they re connected by another bulb,a and i are in the same closed path,0,1,,beetle,0.0
6605,Explain your reasoning.,130,closed path,a and i are in the same closed path,0,1,,beetle,0.0
6606,Explain your reasoning.,130,the are on the same path,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6607,Explain your reasoning.,130,they are all within the same path,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6608,Explain your reasoning.,130,they are on the same path,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6609,Explain your reasoning.,130,they affect one another,a and i are in the same closed path,0,1,,beetle,0.0
6610,Explain your reasoning.,130,bulb a and i are in a closed circuit,a and i are in the same closed path,0,1,,beetle,0.0
6611,Explain your reasoning.,130,bulb a and bulb i affect each other,a and i are in the same closed path,0,1,,beetle,0.0
6612,Explain your reasoning.,130,because breaking one bulb then affects the ability of the others to light up,a and i are in the same closed path,0,1,,beetle,0.0
6613,Explain your reasoning.,130,if one is out the others will go out they are in the same closed path,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6614,Explain your reasoning.,130,they are all on the dame closed path,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6615,Explain your reasoning.,130,they are contained on the same closed path,a and i are in the same closed path,1,1,,beetle,1.0
6616,Explain your reasoning.,130,they are not parallel,a and i are in the same closed path,0,1,,beetle,0.0
6617,Explain your reasoning.,130,removing either a or i will turn off the other bulb,a and i are in the same closed path,0,1,,beetle,0.0

This is like declaring a variable, the programmer knows that he/she will be using in the future, but has yet to say where they are going to use it, or how. This is answers the question who, it gives the function a name and character. The function prototype, by common practice is placed at the beginning of the program after the #includes and before main( ). The FUNCTION DEFINITION is the guts of the function. This is where the programmer decides what the function is going to do and tells it how to do it. It takes whatever information it is given and performs the operations. It works sort of like the brain, the brain takes in input and based upon that input performs in some way producing an output.

1390,How are infix expressions evaluated by computers?,179,"Writing arithmetic expressions is called infix notation.  This is because a binary operator (like '+') is written in between its two operands (as in ""a + b"").  There are two alternative forms of notation used in certain situations.  One is prefix notation, in which an operator is written before its operands.  In prefix notation, the sum of a and b is written ""+ a b"".  This is the notation used to write function calls in mathematics and computer science.  It is also used in the Lisp and Scheme programming languages.  In postfix notation, an operator is written after its operands.  The sum of a and b is written ""a b +"".  (You may have seen this as ""reverse Polish notation"".)  Postfix notation forms the conceptual basis for the way that arithmetic expressions are evaluated by a computer.

1500,How can you implement a queue with a list?,184,theoretically you could do it two ways one of which uses more processing power and memory no larger than the queue is ever at when full and the other which uses almost infinite memory. The more practical method would be two place the items in an array and remove the item in position one of the array after which you can shift the array and add another element if required. The other option which can use infinite memory when used for long term queues such as job scheduling that goes nonstop for extended periods. that is to implement an array and add the items read item one raise your counter value to two ecetera and continue adding more elements to the array. the downside to this method is after you use element one it is still in memory. or im crazy who knows,"Keep the rear of the queue pointing to the tail of the linked list, so the enqueue operation is done at the end of the list, and keep the front of the queue pointing to the head of the linked list, so the dequeue operation is done at the beginning of the list.",2.0,5.0,science,texas
